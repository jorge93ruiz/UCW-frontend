                Uniting Canterbury Women was founded after the tragic terror attack in Christchurch on 15 March 2019.
              </p>
              <p>
                Co-founder, Jo Bailey reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to talk about how to continue on the beautiful love and support for the Muslim community being shown by people in Canterbury and New Zealand, and Uniting Canterbury Women was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zahra introduced Jo to four of her friends, Rebecca Parnham, Dr Hafsa Ahmed, Amber Johnson, and Naeema Masud. The six women bonded over coffee and cake, and together, organised the inaugural Uniting Canterbury Women event, which was attended by nearly 600 women.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Jo Bailey and Rebecca Parnham continue to lead Uniting Canterbury Women and organise a range of events to connect wāhine across all cultures. They are supported by the rest of the UCW team, and new crew member, Suhayla Asghari, when they are available to assist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uniting Canterbury Women has a popular Facebook page with over 1250 followers. Zahra Hussaini runs the group's thriving Instagram page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many incredible connections and friendships have been made and continue to be made across the Uniting Canterbury Women community.

                The original Uniting Canterbury Women crew were delighted to reunite to work on the Welcome Pack project for the Afghan evacuees. They were joined by new crew member, Suhayla Asghari, who filled the spot left by Naeema Masud, who now lives in Sydney.

                  Jo Bailey is a writer, editor, author, publisher, and social change activist, who believes in kindness, celebrating our diversity, and equality for all. Uniting Canterbury Women was created after Jo had the idea to run an event for women, to carry on the feelings of connection and compassion for our Muslim community after the tragic events of 15 March 2019. She reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to chat about the idea, and thanks to Zahra’s amazing connections, UCW was born. Jo continues to co-lead UCW alongside Rebecca Parnham. She is a passionate storyteller, journalist and freelance writer and editor, and is the author of four books. Jo is also an accomplished public speaker, and teaches people how to write their own or family stories during her Writing Life Stories Your Way workshops. She is also the proud mum or two gorgeous grown-ups.

                  Rebecca Parnham has energy to burn and comes up with lots of amazing ideas, that UCW often bring to life. As well as being a mum to two gorgeous girls, Rebecca is passionate about empowering women. She founded social enterprise Krama & Co. that is dedicated to supporting education for girls and providing opportunities for women who weave beautiful krama (hand woven scarves, masks, and other products) which Rebecca imports and sells. She is also the founder of Giving Seeds of Love, which uses craft as a form of therapy whilst making beautiful paper mache hearts. The hearts are made from waste paper from the tributes left outside Al Noor Mosque and the Botanic Gardens after the events of 15 March 2019, and contain wildflower seeds, chosen for their diversity, beauty and resilience. They can be planted in pots or in a garden. Rebecca says when we all work together on initiatives like Seeds of Love in times of trauma or uncertainty, we are able to create a vibrant living reminder of the unity that has been fostered.

                  Zahra Hussaini has a heart of gold and loves to serve her community. She is of Afghan ethnicity, was born in Iran, and came to New Zealand in 2004 as a refugee. After Jo reached out to Zahra about her idea to run an event for women, Zahra brought together four of her other friends over lunch, which was the genesis of Uniting Canterbury Women. Along with being super kind, Zahra is also super busy. She is completing her Science degree as a lab technician, is one of the very hospitable partners in Saffron Restaurant and Café (a must visit!), works as an advocate for the Afghan community and as an interpreter, and has previously run for both Christchurch City Council and Parliament (on the Labour Party list). She also manages to find time to run the Uniting Canterbury Women Instagram page. Zahra loves coffee, meeting new people and socialising. She believes in actions - not only words, something she lives by every day.

                  One-of-a-kind, Amber Johnson has the biggest heart and has been an active volunteer in the Christchurch community for well over a decade. She helped to create a Children’s Group for children affected by their loved ones’ addictions and in 2017, created free community education evenings called CED (Community Education Discussion) Nights, which focused on a range of important topics. Amber worked collaboratively with Christchurch Resettlement Services to create and initiate a wonderful community craft group project, which she still runs, called Craft Without Borders. The aim of the project is to connect former refugees with the wider community, and open channels for people to come together to work on a project, teach, learn and get involved in their community through creativity. Last but not least, Amber has been a volunteer for the Street Wise Feed the East Programme and continues to volunteer at a dog shelter. On top of her incredible volunteer efforts, Amber manages to fit in a full time IT support role at Ara Polytechnic. She enjoys getting into the outdoors with her Latvian husband, and beloved dog, Luna, and is also in the process of becoming a qualified yoga instructor.

                  In addition to her full-time role as a lecturer at Lincoln University, Dr Hafsa Ahmed seeks to make a meaningful impact in the world through service. Guided by her values of faith and freedom, she is often involved in initiatives that serve her purpose. She believes her approach to life is best captured through this quote: “The value of our lives is not determined by what we do for ourselves. The value of our lives is determined by what we do for others.” (Simon Sinek). Therefore, together with her husband Razi, Hafsa founded the Lady Khadija Charitable Trust, which believes in the principles of ‘empowering communities through compassion.’ The Trust has initiated a wide range of exciting projects to achieve social cohesion in the community which includes the Boxes of Love project, podcast OpenTable, the annual interfaith discussion forum Together in Humanity and more recently Immigrant Journeys. Hafsa also serves as the current Chair of the Canterbury Interfaith Society and a Board member at Ako Ōtautahi Learning City Christchurch. Her latest initiative is a series titled ‘Unquiet Women’ supported by Asia Medic Centre, which features stories about Asian women in Aotearoa, New Zealand as she hopes these stories will bring Asia closer to New Zealand by enabling us to see through the eyes of others and nurturing connections.

                  Before she moved to Sydney, Naeema Masud was a valued member of the Uniting Canterbury crew, who went about things in her lovely quiet way. Naeema is from Afghanistan and came to New Zealand in 2000 after four years living in Pakistan. She worked as a customer service operator, before unfortunately being made redundant after the Christchurch earthquakes. In 2010, Naeema married her husband, Jawad Arefi, they have been blessed with two lovely boys, named Bahram and Ali. Naeema’s children are the joy of her life, and Bahram is currently learning three languages – English, Farsi and Arabic. Before leaving New Zealand for Sydney with her family, Naeema was an active member of her community. She was also studying an Arabic translation course to form a deeper connection with the Qur’an and to implement the greatness of it into her daily life.
