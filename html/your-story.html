                  New UCW ‘crew’ member Suhayla Asghari joined us for our Welcome Pack initiative and has her own amazing story of arriving in New Zealand as an Afghan refugee.

                    When Suhayla Asghari arrived in New Zealand as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2004, she was an 11-year-old girl who spoke little English, and had already survived life-threatening situations, including capture by the Taliban.
                    It was difficult for Suhayla to adapt to life in New Zealand in the beginning, and she found it difficult to communicate with her classmates. It took two years before she started to feel comfortable here.
                    Since those early days, Suhayla found her wings and thrived, getting her degree and achieving a Master of Social Work from the University of Canterbury. She currently works at Māori health and social services organisation Purapura Whetu as a Wellbeing Practitioner, tirelessly supporting the Muslim community.
                    Co-founder of Uniting Canterbury Women, Dr Hafsa Ahmed has written a wonderful profile of Suhayla for her series ‘Unquiet Women’ about Asian women who have migrated to New Zealand, and which is supported by the Asia Media Centre.

                    When Uniting Canterbury Women was organising our inaugural event in 2019, we thought it might be nice to include a small Linden Leaves product in the gift packs we were planning to give to each woman who came to the event. So we reached out to Brigit Blair, founder of the internationally renowned Christchurch company to see what we could purchase with our very small budget.
                    We were certainly not counting on Brigit’s incredible generosity. The gift packs we gave out that night became the stuff of legend, as they included not one, but four, beautiful full-sized Linden Leaves products.
                    We love having Brigit as such a wonderful supporter of Uniting Canterbury Women and are inspired by her incredible business success story. Did you know that Brigit founded Linden Leaves in her kitchen in 1995, after struggling to find natural and effective skincare for her children, who suffered from severe eczema and allergies? She started hand-making her own beautiful and effective natural products, using oils and the best ingredients.
                    From these humble beginnings, Linden Leaves has grown into a thriving international brand, which has won numerous awards, both in New Zealand, and globally for its luxury, handmade natural skincare, body care and beautiful scented products for the home, which are now available in nine countries.
                    We were delighted to have Brigit as our very first online ‘Dinner Club’ guest in July 2020, when she provided a fascinating insight into her inspiring story. She also shared some important wellbeing tips, and advice for thriving in life and business in the COVID-19 world.

                    Most of us would have seen the Nurse Maude cars zipping around Christchurch, driven by caring district nurses and palliative care nurses doing amazing work in our community.
                    Did you now that the wonderful work of the ‘original’ Nurse Maude – a Christchurch nurse named Sibylla Emily Maude, led to the birth of district nursing in Christchurch and around New Zealand?
                    Born in 1862, the eldest of eight children, Sibylla grew up in a deeply religious Anglican family. The example set by her father, who was at the time of her birth, Provincial Secretary, and two of her aunts who were nurses appears to have inspired in her a desire to help other people.
                    She rose to the role of matron of Christchurch Hospital by 1893 but left that role in 1896 to begin the work for which she was most remembered – caring for the old, infirm and poor in their own homes.
                    Nurse Maude got financial backing to undertake district nursing in the city, and established a headquarters in Durham Street, which served as a dispensary and a place where minor ailments were treated. In 1901, the District Nursing Association was founded to support the work.
                    Dressed in a light-blue uniform and white apron with dark-blue cape and bonnet, Nurse Maude walked many miles every day in all weathers, carrying not only nursing equipment but often the pans for cooking, cleaning and washing which many people lacked. She tried to teach her patients the importance of cleanliness and fresh air, and as a woman of prayer she invariably prayed with them.
                    More nurses joined – and a horse and cart and bicycles were provided to transport them.
                    Nurse Maude opened two sanitoriums for tuberculosis in Christchurch and during the influenza epidemic which started in 1918, was put in charge of the central bureau to coordinate the nursing of influenza victims in the city. In the difficult 1920s she opened a soup kitchen for undernourished children.
                    Nurse Maude never married and died on 12 July 1935. Her funeral was attended by large crowds who came to pay tribute to the most celebrated women in the city at the time.
                    She was greatly respected and loved for her genuine practical sympathy for the poor and her complete integrity. Thanks to the impact of her work, district nursing was developed throughout the country.

                  New UCW ‘crew’ member Suhayla Asghari joined us for our Welcome Pack initiative and has her own amazing story of arriving in New Zealand as an Afghan refugee.

                    When Suhayla Asghari arrived in New Zealand as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2004, she was an 11-year-old girl who spoke little English, and had already survived life-threatening situations, including capture by the Taliban.
                    It was difficult for Suhayla to adapt to life in New Zealand in the beginning, and she found it difficult to communicate with her classmates. It took two years before she started to feel comfortable here.
                    Since those early days, Suhayla found her wings and thrived, getting her degree and achieving a Master of Social Work from the University of Canterbury. She currently works at Māori health and social services organisation Purapura Whetu as a Wellbeing Practitioner, tirelessly supporting the Muslim community.
                    Co-founder of Uniting Canterbury Women, Dr Hafsa Ahmed has written a wonderful profile of Suhayla for her series ‘Unquiet Women’ about Asian women who have migrated to New Zealand, and which is supported by the Asia Media Centre.

                    When Uniting Canterbury Women was organising our inaugural event in 2019, we thought it might be nice to include a small Linden Leaves product in the gift packs we were planning to give to each woman who came to the event. So we reached out to Brigit Blair, founder of the internationally renowned Christchurch company to see what we could purchase with our very small budget.
                    We were certainly not counting on Brigit’s incredible generosity. The gift packs we gave out that night became the stuff of legend, as they included not one, but four, beautiful full-sized Linden Leaves products.
                    We love having Brigit as such a wonderful supporter of Uniting Canterbury Women and are inspired by her incredible business success story. Did you know that Brigit founded Linden Leaves in her kitchen in 1995, after struggling to find natural and effective skincare for her children, who suffered from severe eczema and allergies? She started hand-making her own beautiful and effective natural products, using oils and the best ingredients.
                    From these humble beginnings, Linden Leaves has grown into a thriving international brand, which has won numerous awards, both in New Zealand, and globally for its luxury, handmade natural skincare, body care and beautiful scented products for the home, which are now available in nine countries.
                    We were delighted to have Brigit as our very first online ‘Dinner Club’ guest in July 2020, when she provided a fascinating insight into her inspiring story. She also shared some important wellbeing tips, and advice for thriving in life and business in the COVID-19 world.

                  The story of the real ‘Nurse Maude’ and her incredible legacy is truly fascinating. She was a genuine trailblazer.

                    Most of us would have seen the Nurse Maude cars zipping around Christchurch, driven by caring district nurses and palliative care nurses doing amazing work in our community.
                    Did you now that the wonderful work of the ‘original’ Nurse Maude – a Christchurch nurse named Sibylla Emily Maude, led to the birth of district nursing in Christchurch and around New Zealand?
                    Born in 1862, the eldest of eight children, Sibylla grew up in a deeply religious Anglican family. The example set by her father, who was at the time of her birth, Provincial Secretary, and two of her aunts who were nurses appears to have inspired in her a desire to help other people.
                    She rose to the role of matron of Christchurch Hospital by 1893 but left that role in 1896 to begin the work for which she was most remembered – caring for the old, infirm and poor in their own homes.
                    Nurse Maude got financial backing to undertake district nursing in the city, and established a headquarters in Durham Street, which served as a dispensary and a place where minor ailments were treated. In 1901, the District Nursing Association was founded to support the work.
                    Dressed in a light-blue uniform and white apron with dark-blue cape and bonnet, Nurse Maude walked many miles every day in all weathers, carrying not only nursing equipment but often the pans for cooking, cleaning and washing which many people lacked. She tried to teach her patients the importance of cleanliness and fresh air, and as a woman of prayer she invariably prayed with them.
                    More nurses joined – and a horse and cart and bicycles were provided to transport them.
                    Nurse Maude opened two sanitoriums for tuberculosis in Christchurch and during the influenza epidemic which started in 1918, was put in charge of the central bureau to coordinate the nursing of influenza victims in the city. In the difficult 1920s she opened a soup kitchen for undernourished children.
                    Nurse Maude never married and died on 12 July 1935. Her funeral was attended by large crowds who came to pay tribute to the most celebrated women in the city at the time.
                    She was greatly respected and loved for her genuine practical sympathy for the poor and her complete integrity. Thanks to the impact of her work, district nursing was developed throughout the country.
