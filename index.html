              Uniting Canterbury Women connects women of all ethnicities, cultures and religions at a series of exciting live and online events, and through our various online platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our purpose is to break down barriers, and provide a welcome space where women can connect, communicate, collaborate, enjoy events, workshops and activities together, learn from each other, and work together to make a difference in our communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also love to champion the great works and initiatives of other Canterbury wāhine, and to tell the stories of inspiring wāhine in our community in our regular newsletter, on our website, and through our social media channels.

                  <p>
                    Despite being the classic Kiwi Christmas dessert, until last year, I had never actually made a pavlova myself! My brother was the pavlova maker in our family, and after he sadly passed away last year, I decided to make one for our family Christmas, to honour his memory. I was a little nervous about giving it a go for the first time, but by following these top tips gleaned from a good recipe, and chatting to my expert pavlova making friend – it turned out brilliantly. I hope yours does too!

                    <b>Pavlova</b>
                    Simple tips for achieving the perfect pavlova:
                    1. Use older eggs (at room temperature) as the whites break down easier
                    2. Wipe your bowl beforehand with lemon juice to remove any greasy residue
                    3. Use caster sugar and not regular sugar as the fine crystals trap and hold more air
                    4. Beat your mixture for at least 10 minutes
                    5. Have your oven on regular bake (not fan bake)
                    6. Leave the pavlova in the oven for ages after it's cooked

                    Recipe:
                    6 egg whites (at room temperature)
                    2 cups caster sugar
                    1 tsp vanilla essence
                    1 tsp white vinegar
                    2 tsp cornflour
                    300m cream whipped, plus fruit, chocolate etc for decorating

                    Pre-heat over to 110 degrees celsius (not fan bake)
                    Line a baking tray with baking paper.
                    In a large metal, ceramic or glass bowl (not plastic), beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.
                    Continue beating while gradually adding the caster sugar - a quarter of a cup at the time. (I beat each quarter of a cup in for a minute and a half before adding the next one). The mixture should become thick and glossy.
                    Once all the sugar has been beaten in (minimum 10-12 minutes in total), beat in the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour.
                    Spoon the mixture onto the prepared tray, and shape similar to the example in my photo.
                    Bake for approximately 1.5 hours, until dry and crisp and the pavlova lifts easily off the baking paper. Turn the oven off and leave the pavlova inside for at least an hour before removing from the oven (I recommend leaving for much longer - 4-5 hours, or even longer).
                    When completely cool, place on a serving dish, add whipped cream and toppings of your choice.

                    <b>NB:</b> Don't be surprised if the crust is a bit broken looking when it comes out of the oven. I was worried mine had failed to start with but when we cut into it, the centre was soft, light and fluffy. And the toppings hid any broken bits on top! You can make your pavlova the day before you intend to serve it, but it's a good idea to eat any leftovers within 24 hours of serving.

                  <p>Uniting Canterbury Women was devasted to hear about the plight of the evacuees who fled Afghanistan to New Zealand at the end of August to escape the brutal new Taliban regime. Many men, women and children went through an incredibly traumatic time to get here and arrived with little more than the clothes on their backs.
                  We were determined to do something to help, so started a Givealittle campaign to raise money to create individual Welcome Packs for the evacuees at the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre. This was a cause especially close to our hearts, as two of our current crew members, Zahra Hussaini, and Suhayla Asghari are former refugees from Afghanistan. They both spent time at the Centre on their arrival to New Zealand, and never forgot the kindnesses they received.
                  We easily surpassed our goal to raise $11,000 – reaching over $14,000 in the end thanks to great support from Kiwi donors. Our campaign also attracted the support of generous social enterprises and businesses who either donated goods for the packs, or offered wholesale prices or less. Even former Prime Minister, Helen Clark got behind the Givealittle campaign, mentioning it almost daily on her social media platforms, and there was a story on 1News at Midday talking about the initiative.
                  In early October, with the help of some awesome women, we packaged up around 250 very special Welcome Packs, filled with items that would introduce the evacuees to their new country, and also remind them of home. The packs included fragrant spices, saffron, and tea which was specially blended by Zahra.
                  The women were gifted beautiful silk krama (scarves) handwoven in Cambodia, Linden Leaves products and TradeAid bags, among many other items, while prayer mats, woollen hats and thermos flasks were among the items in the men's packs.
                  We were so excited to hear that the packs arrived in Auckland, and can’t wait for the feedback from the Centre.

              Tea for Three - June 2022
            </div>
            <p>
              We had a brilliant surprise at our online Tea for Three event in June, when the wonderful Jacqui joined us all the way from California! She saw our event on Eventbrite, checked out our website to make sure we were kosha, and stayed up until 12.30am to join us. It was another great night of wonderful connection and conversation, and we heard about some new friendships forming as a result.

              Tea for Three – May 2022
            </div>
            <p>
              We were buzzing after our inaugural Tea for Three event in early May. Thanks so much to the fabulous women who joined us for this fun evening of connection and conversations. Tea for Three is an online event, with a super simple format. We randomly split the main group into groups of three in separate 'Zoom rooms' with some fun starter questions to break the ice and prompt a 15-minute conversation. The women had three conversations during the evening, and we all came back to the main room at the end. It was such a great event that we have decided to create a ‘Winter Series’ of Tea for Three online events, which will culminate in an in-person Tea for Three event for all who attended an online session, giving them the chance to meet their new friends in person.

              UCW Writing Life Stories Your Way Workshop – March 2022
            </div>
            <p>
              In March, UCW co-founder Jo Bailey, ran a Writing Life Stories Your Way Workshop for a group of predominantly Muslim women, to help them to get their stories onto the page. Alongside the learning, it was a wonderful session of sharing, with some incredible stories told at the event, which was held at Te Whare Waiutuutu Kate Sheppard House. We can’t wait to hear about the women’s future storytelling progress!

              UCW hosts Narrative 4 – February 2022
            </div>
            <p>
              In February, we were delighted to help Shannon Malik and Steffi Brightwell of Narrative 4 launch the Christchurch branch of the story exchange organisation at Te Whare Waiutuutu Kate Sheppard House. The House was the perfect, private, peaceful setting for our wahine to dive deep, be vulnerable and share some incredible stories about a moment in their lives when they felt powerful. A big thank you to Shannon and Steffi for creating a safe space and guiding us through the process, which really helped us all to build confidence and empathy, and to hold the space for another wahine's story, which was then shared with the group. It was very powerful, and we had an insightful debrief at the end about the many positives we took from the day.

              Around the World in Eight Cafes – Five Star Vietnamese Restaurant – November 2021
            </div>
            <p>
              There was so much chatter and amazing energy at our Around the World in Eight Cafes event at Five Star Vietnamese Restaurant, on 19 November 2021. We tried to seat women alongside people they don't know to encourage new friendships. We placed some 'connection' questions on each of the tables, but the conversations were so instant the questions were really not needed. Thanks again to Gina Satterthwaite and the Fife Foundation for supporting this event, and Li from Five Star Vietnamese Restaurant for her amazing hosting and delicious food (definitely worth five stars). We also enjoyed hearing from Li's daughter, Hannah, who gave us a great short talk about Vietnamese food and their family restaurant (at Fendalton Village Mall) which we highly recommend visiting!

            Around the World in Eight Cafes
          </div>
          <p>
            Uniting Canterbury Women hosts coffee and food catch ups for women from all cultures and ethnicities in Christchurch. Each time, the groups meet at a different ethnic café, to connect, share stories, share food, and learn new things about the food and culture from the café owner. Not only is it a great way to connect women, we also learn about different cuisines and cultures, and support small local ethnic businesses. It’s a win win!
          </p>

            We are grateful to The Christchurch Foundation, and Fife Foundation, for their support of our Around the World in Eight Cafes initiative.

                Uniting Canterbury Women was founded after the tragic terror attack in Christchurch on 15 March 2019.
              </p>
              <p>
                Co-founder, Jo Bailey reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to talk about how to continue on the beautiful love and support for the Muslim community being shown by people in Canterbury and New Zealand, and Uniting Canterbury Women was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zahra introduced Jo to four of her friends, Rebecca Parnham, Dr Hafsa Ahmed, Amber Johnson, and Naeema Masud. The six women bonded over coffee and cake, and together, organised the inaugural Uniting Canterbury Women event, which was attended by nearly 600 women.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Jo Bailey and Rebecca Parnham continue to lead Uniting Canterbury Women and organise a range of events to connect wāhine across all cultures. They are supported by the rest of the UCW team, and new crew member, Suhayla Asghari, when they are available to assist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uniting Canterbury Women has a popular Facebook page with over 1250 followers. Zahra Hussaini runs the group's thriving Instagram page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many incredible connections and friendships have been made and continue to be made across the Uniting Canterbury Women community.

                The original Uniting Canterbury Women crew were delighted to reunite to work on the Welcome Pack project for the Afghan evacuees. They were joined by new crew member, Suhayla Asghari, who filled the spot left by Naeema Masud, who now lives in Sydney.

                    Jo Bailey is a writer, editor, author, publisher, and social change activist, who believes in kindness, celebrating our diversity, and equality for all. Uniting Canterbury Women was created after Jo had the idea to run an event for women, to carry on the feelings of connection and compassion for our Muslim community after the tragic events of 15 March 2019. She reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to chat about the idea, and thanks to Zahra’s amazing connections, UCW was born. Jo continues to co-lead UCW alongside Rebecca Parnham. She is a passionate storyteller, journalist and freelance writer and editor, and is the author of four books. Jo is also an accomplished public speaker, and teaches people how to write their own or family stories during her Writing Life Stories Your Way workshops. She is also the proud mum or two gorgeous grown-ups.

                    Rebecca Parnham has energy to burn and comes up with lots of amazing ideas, that UCW often bring to life. As well as being a mum to two gorgeous girls, Rebecca is passionate about empowering women. She founded social enterprise Krama & Co. that is dedicated to supporting education for girls and providing opportunities for women who weave beautiful krama (hand woven scarves, masks, and other products) which Rebecca imports and sells. She is also the founder of Giving Seeds of Love, which uses craft as a form of therapy whilst making beautiful paper mache hearts. The hearts are made from waste paper from the tributes left outside Al Noor Mosque and the Botanic Gardens after the events of 15 March 2019, and contain wildflower seeds, chosen for their diversity, beauty and resilience. They can be planted in pots or in a garden. Rebecca says when we all work together on initiatives like Seeds of Love in times of trauma or uncertainty, we are able to create a vibrant living reminder of the unity that has been fostered.

                    Zahra Hussaini has a heart of gold and loves to serve her community. She is of Afghan ethnicity, was born in Iran, and came to New Zealand in 2004 as a refugee. After Jo reached out to Zahra about her idea to run an event for women, Zahra brought together four of her other friends over lunch, which was the genesis of Uniting Canterbury Women. Along with being super kind, Zahra is also super busy. She is completing her Science degree as a lab technician, is one of the very hospitable partners in Saffron Restaurant and Café (a must visit!), works as an advocate for the Afghan community and as an interpreter, and has previously run for both Christchurch City Council and Parliament (on the Labour Party list). She also manages to find time to run the Uniting Canterbury Women Instagram page. Zahra loves coffee, meeting new people and socialising. She believes in actions - not only words, something she lives by every day.

                    One-of-a-kind, Amber Johnson has the biggest heart and has been an active volunteer in the Christchurch community for well over a decade. She helped to create a Children’s Group for children affected by their loved ones’ addictions and in 2017, created free community education evenings called CED (Community Education Discussion) Nights, which focused on a range of important topics. Amber worked collaboratively with Christchurch Resettlement Services to create and initiate a wonderful community craft group project, which she still runs, called Craft Without Borders. The aim of the project is to connect former refugees with the wider community, and open channels for people to come together to work on a project, teach, learn and get involved in their community through creativity. Last but not least, Amber has been a volunteer for the Street Wise Feed the East Programme and continues to volunteer at a dog shelter. On top of her incredible volunteer efforts, Amber manages to fit in a full time IT support role at Ara Polytechnic. She enjoys getting into the outdoors with her Latvian husband, and beloved dog, Luna, and is also in the process of becoming a qualified yoga instructor.

                    In addition to her full-time role as a lecturer at Lincoln University, Dr Hafsa Ahmed seeks to make a meaningful impact in the world through service. Guided by her values of faith and freedom, she is often involved in initiatives that serve her purpose. She believes her approach to life is best captured through this quote: “The value of our lives is not determined by what we do for ourselves. The value of our lives is determined by what we do for others.” (Simon Sinek). Therefore, together with her husband Razi, Hafsa founded the Lady Khadija Charitable Trust, which believes in the principles of ‘empowering communities through compassion.’ The Trust has initiated a wide range of exciting projects to achieve social cohesion in the community which includes the Boxes of Love project, podcast OpenTable, the annual interfaith discussion forum Together in Humanity and more recently Immigrant Journeys. Hafsa also serves as the current Chair of the Canterbury Interfaith Society and a Board member at Ako Ōtautahi Learning City Christchurch. Her latest initiative is a series titled ‘Unquiet Women’ supported by Asia Medic Centre, which features stories about Asian women in Aotearoa, New Zealand as she hopes these stories will bring Asia closer to New Zealand by enabling us to see through the eyes of others and nurturing connections.

                    Before she moved to Sydney, Naeema Masud was a valued member of the Uniting Canterbury crew, who went about things in her lovely quiet way. Naeema is from Afghanistan and came to New Zealand in 2000 after four years living in Pakistan. She worked as a customer service operator, before unfortunately being made redundant after the Christchurch earthquakes. In 2010, Naeema married her husband, Jawad Arefi, they have been blessed with two lovely boys, named Bahram and Ali. Naeema’s children are the joy of her life, and Bahram is currently learning three languages – English, Farsi and Arabic. Before leaving New Zealand for Sydney with her family, Naeema was an active member of her community. She was also studying an Arabic translation course to form a deeper connection with the Qur’an and to implement the greatness of it into her daily life.

                    <b>Amplifying voices and empowering communities</b>

                    In a relatively non-descript brick building on bustling Madras Street, some incredible community work has been going on for over 35 years, and continues to reach every corner of Ōtautahi Christchurch and beyond.

                    The building is home to Plains FM, a multi-award winning local radio station, which over its long history has been a platform for diverse perspectives, amplifying the voices of people from all walks and life and backgrounds.

                    Do you have a great idea for a radio show? At Plains FM there is no barrier to you becoming a broadcaster and joining the current hosts of more than 90 radio shows in 20 languages being produced at the station. This is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Plains FM, that anyone truly can become a broadcaster and bring their idea to life, with the encouragement, support and training of the station’s team.

                    At the helm of this extraordinary endeavour is Station Manager, Nicki Reece, who joined Plains FM way back in 1989, just a year after it was founded. She had just finished a course in Radio Broadcasting, heard about a production role at Plains FM, had a chat to the station manager at the time, and the rest is history. Nicki has managed Plains FM since 2007, and her dedication, passion and hard work was rewarded with a New Zealand Radio Award for Services to Broadcasting in 2021. “I was overwhelmed. It was a beautiful thing, and felt like it wasn’t just celebrating my journey, but all those people who had come along with me over my time here,” says Nicki.

                    Plains FM is one of 12 stations in New Zealand which is part of the Community Access Media Alliance (CAMA). It produces a range of broadcasts to provide for the interests of women, youth, children, persons with disabilities and minorities in the community, including ethnic minorities. “Migrant communities hold a special place in our programming and are definitely a priority group. Their shows celebrate culture, language, traditions and effectively reach and connect with people within their communities,” says Nicki.

                    Content Co-ordinator, Laura Gartner has been employed by Plains FM for 9 years, but was a broadcaster back in 1993 with the Earthwise environmental show. During her time in the role, she has been responsible for introducing countless new broadcasters to the airwaves, including many women from migrant communities. “I come from a social justice background and it is really important to me that marginalised voices are part of the media landscape. You don’t find this in mainstream media, but here at Plains FM, people can present their own stories and ideas in their own language, in their own style and there are no barriers. Equity of access is so important.”

                    A few days after the terror attack on 15 March 2019, Nicki and Laura met with local journalist, Lana Hart, to talk about how Plains FM could do its bit to support the local community through the trauma. The result was a show called After March 15th, which went on to win Best Access Radio Programme at the 2021 New Zealand Radio Awards. This led to a funded project – the powerful Widows of Shuhada, which followed the journey through grief of four Muslim women widowed by the attack. This show was a finalist in the Best Documentary or Factual Talk Feature category at the awards. Also in 2021, Laura was part of the team which produced the show, It’s Getting Hot in Here, about climate change, which won Best Access Radio Programme.

                    Plains FM broadcasts 24/7 and is a much-loved companion for many engaged listeners. Its shows can also be listened to on demand on the station’s website and podcast platforms.

                    One of its longest running shows is a weekly, hour-long Tongan language show called, Faka'amanaki, which Siale Faitotonu has been running for 30 years. “Siale is amazing. He is a super busy man but makes the show every week as a service to his community. It provides important messages in the Tongan language and creates important cultural connections,” says Laura. Other Pasifika content makers have been on air for over 10 and even 20 years.

                    Nicki says these shows were running long before the concept of keeping languages alive really came into vogue, and various Pacific Language Weeks were introduced. “These broadcasters have been committed since way back then to making those connections and maintaining their language and culture through the programmes.”

                    Many broadcasters from ethnic communities record their shows in English, which helps to create strong cross-cultural connections, providing opportunities for English speakers to listen, learn and gain another perspective on the world, says Nicki.

                    A snapshot of Plains FM’s current and new shows highlight the station’s incredible diversity. An upcoming show, Cult Chat, is being made by three women who have survived cult-like environments. As well as telling their own incredible stories, they are interviewing others with similar experiences. In July, Muslim life coach, Fariya Naseem is launching Pep Talk, which provides advice for women in challenging situations. The day Uniting Canterbury Women visited Plains FM’s studios, Mercy Munatsi was working with Laura Gartner on her show called African Renaissance, which plays a variety of stunning African music. Another new show to hit the airwaves is Rock for Recovery, created by Carl, a former mental health specialist, who uses examples of hard rock music to support people through mental health and addiction issues.

                    Many different groups from the disability sector have enjoyed the opportunity to make their own shows at Plains FM, which also supports schools and youth broadcasters. The School for Young Writers has produced a series of radio plays. There are endless creative opportunities to be explored.

                    Nicki says the most popular show in terms of audience numbers is the weekly podcast created by Alcoholics Anonymous, featuring stories of recovering alcoholics.

                    What can you expect if you have an idea for a new radio show at Plains FM? Most new broadcasters start out knowing nothing at all about radio, but if they have an idea or passion, Plains FM can help them turn it into a show, says Laura. “We bring them into the station, show them around the facilities, talk them through the process, and walk them through every step of the way at their own pace, including training on all the elements that go into making a programme. Some people want to work with us on the technical aspects, and many go on to learn to record and edit the shows themselves once they feel comfortable with the technology.”

                    Broadcasters pay a small, very reasonable fee for the training process, and for each 25-minute episode of their shows.

                    As well as her pivotal role bringing new broadcasters into Plains FM’s ever-growing network, Laura has been active out in the community, recording various live events and public speakers, with the recordings later played on the radio. She has recorded everything from engaging lectures at University of Canterbury, to talks by interesting guest speakers at Quaker meetings, and Canterbury Workers Education Association meetings. The Plains FM team even recorded Uniting Canterbury Women’s inaugural event in July 2019.

                    Plains FM is also positively impacting on the education sector. It has recently launched Content Making for Radio and Podcasts, a comprehensive programme, which fits into the New Zealand Curriculum and NCEA frameworks. The programme guides students, particularly those studying English, Media Studies and Digital Technology, right through the audio content production process. “Communication is key these days, but not everyone knows how to make a really good audio show. This resource, which is available for schools to purchase, helps students to make great content, and earn the credits they need to fulfill curriculum requirements. The programme is a great resource for teachers, as it reduces the amount of time they need to spend planning, preparing and organising these projects.”

                    Sadly, Laura's tenure at Plains FM is coming to an end later in June as she heads back to Canada for several months for family reasons. “It has been an absolute privilege and amazing experience to work here. I’ve met so many people who have shared their stories and life stories with me and the station. One of the greatest things is seeing people gain their confidence, after coming into the station for the first time feeling scared and nervous. It’s such a great feeling to be able to support their vision so they can achieve their goals. That’s been a highlight, along with a great team to work with, and the exposure to so many different cultures, and different ways of thinking.”

                    Laura’s departure will undoubtedly leave a void, but the Plains FM team will share her role until a new person is employed, supported by Nicki who will help out with induction and training as needed. “There is a lot of sadness about losing Laura. I will miss her hugely but she leaves such a positive legacy, with her unwavering dedication allowing countless individuals to find their voice and share their stories. I am confident that because Plains FM is such a special place, good people always end up here, and we will ensure that Laura’s legacy of nurturing connections continues on. We are sure the wonderful relationship we have with Laura will continue once she returns to Christchurch. Hopefully she will come back and make another fabulous programme with us.”

                    As she reflects on her 34 years at Plains FM, Nicki is grateful for the ways she has been stretched and grown in many areas in her role, including personal development, the ability to connect with people from all walks of life, keeping up with technological changes, creative thinking, and being flexible. She is rightly proud of the station’s amazing work of the past and present, and is excited as it looks ahead to the future. “Plains FM will continue to evolve and innovate and ensure that everyone’s voice can be heard and celebrated. The legacy of community empowerment will remain at the core of everything we do.”

                    <b>Living her dreams</b>

                    Fariya Naseem’s inspirational story is about chasing big dreams through sheer will and determination, creating her own destiny rather than being bound by society’s expectations of her, and forging a new life for her family in a country much different to her own.

                    Over a decade ago, back in India, and unable to follow her desired career path because of circumstances, even after gaining two degrees. Fariya made a dynamic decision, with the support of her husband, that would change the course of her family's life forever. It is a story of separation, love, drive, hard work, and unfailing self-belief. Now Fariya is living her dream as a much-loved secondary school Physics teacher, and a certified life coach in Ōtautahi Christchurch, drawing on all the lessons from her own life and struggles as she helps others to reach for their goals and dreams.

                    Fariya’s story begins in Bhopal, India, where she was born to a Science teacher mother, and a police officer father. A lifelong love of reading was shaped by her mother, who regularly bought Fariya and her younger brother Ladybird books to read. “I loved all the fairy tales, and all other stories from Ladybird series. My favourite was Little Red Riding Hood. At times we would be upstairs on the terrace under the stars and mum would narrate the stories of Sindbad the Sailor.”

                    Celebrating various cultures and festivals was an important part of Fariya’s upbringing. Her father placed great emphasis in recognising other faiths and cultures. Muslim by birth, she was raised very multi-cultural. “We celebrated Diwali to Christmas, alongside Eid and Ramadan. Dad made sure that we visited neighbours from other cultures on their festivals and invited them to ours. I have learnt a lot from my upbringing.”

                    Although living in a ‘secure environment with a beautiful family’, Fariya says two life-changing incidents stand out from her childhood. “I was just two years old when the Bhopal gas tragedy struck in 1984. At the time, it was considered the worst industrial disaster in history. Thousands of people died when dangerous gas escaped from the Union Carbide fertilizer plant and covered the city. Even though I was so young, I remember my parents putting a scarf on my nose and wrapping me in a blanket as we fled to my grandparents’ house in a nearby village. We were there for a month or two before we could go home.”

                    As a 10-year-old, Fariya found herself caught up in riots in Bhopal, when police tried to control communal riots. “I had two younger children from my school with me and we ran for our lives. With rioters chasing us I took shelter along with those children in a house closer to my home and saved our lives. It was a while before they would let us into the house. That feeling of protection came naturally to me.”

                    As she grew older, Fariya’s love of books translated into a love of learning. When she was 18, she started a degree in Electrical Engineering, and around the same time got engaged. “There is a lot of societal pressure if you are a Muslim girl born in a good Indian family. You are expected to follow the rules, keep the traditions and culture alive, and probably accept an arranged marriage. During my first year of College, my parents found some eligible young men for me to choose from, and I met my future husband, Sadat Naseem.”

                    As a woman of belief and with ambitions beyond the societal expectation of being a ‘good wife’, Fariya says it was difficult seeing people she had studied Engineering with being offered great employment packages, while she was overlooked because she was a woman. “One of the interviewers who came to the College said I was brilliant at the course but he wouldn’t take me on because I was getting married soon.”

                    Married at 21, she tried really hard in the beginning to fit into the cultural norms. “I began to resent not being able to go to work and use my education in the career I had planned. I was lucky my husband was there with me, as when he saw how unhappy I was, he said he would support me in whatever I wanted to do. He became my pillar and kept me safe from the expectations that were being placed on me.”

                    Every couple of years the couple moved due to Sadat’s job in the army. Fariya took part time positions as an engineer, and continued to study. “I would pick a course or degree that was in front of me and would just do it for the sake of learning.” She worked hard towards gaining two Oracle certificates from Oracle University Washington for coding programmes, and a Bachelor of Education from University of Kashmir.

                    During this time, her beloved father passed away, which was a huge wrench, given how close they were.

                    With Sadat moving higher up in the army, Fariya said life was very comfortable. She had a lovely home with staff, a beautiful baby son, Faraj, and a happy marriage to a supportive husband. “Sadat would support me in everything, taking me to College, arranging things at home, making endless cups of tea while I was studying at night towards my Bachelor of Education. He proves that males can be different too – that they don’t necessarily fit into the stereotype.”

                    Despite having ‘everything’ on the outside, Fariya still yearned for more. This is when she came up with an idea for a very different future for her family, one which might have put a less strong marriage to the test. “As Faraj grew and started school, I thought a lot about how I wanted my child to live a life away from the stereotypical world and modelling based on gender. I had already proved to myself I could study well, so had the idea to go to New Zealand to further my studies in education at the University of Canterbury, and ultimately find a job as a teacher there.”

                    One sticking point for the couple was that Sadat was committed to the army for 20 years, and still had six years left to go. “I said I couldn’t wait another six years, as those were very impressionable years for Faraj. Once again, he supported me. When I told my mother I was going to go to Christchurch to study, she said ‘Have you gone mad?’”

                    To meet the high levels of English required to teach in New Zealand, it was back to the books for Fariya, who by this time was teaching in an army school. “I would work all day, study every night from 9pm to 2am, then get up at 7am to go to work.”

                    After passing her English Language Testing Examination, Fariya started putting plans in place to go to New Zealand. “I decided on New Zealand because I wanted to be in a country where I wouldn’t be judged for who I am. I also loved the Māori culture, and especially the way Māori people greeted each other. To me it was like an exchange of soul.”

                    Although she initially planned to bring Faraj with her to New Zealand, she decided it was best to begin with, to leave him behind in India with Sadat and her mother, who agreed to move into their home and help care for him.

                    After a long flight over endless blue sea, Fariya arrived alone in Christchurch in February 2013, not knowing anyone in the country. “It was a beautiful evening. A person from the University of Canterbury picked me up and took me to a hostel at Church Corner where I had two nights’ accommodation booked. I was feeling so happy, excited and spirited. I told myself this was going to be a beautiful journey.”

                    After two nights, Fariya knew she would have to find somewhere to live. She is a great believer in synchronicity, which was definitely in play on this February day. “I was walking around the College of Education when an elderly man and I exchanged a smile as we passed. I turned around, and said, ‘Excuse me. I’m looking for accommodation – do you know of any rooms available for students?’ He said, ‘See that house over there, my friends from Sri Lanka have just bought it and are looking for a flatmate.’”

                    Fariya knocked on the door of the house, and met the husband and wife, who had only moved in the night before. They were very happy to take her on as their flatmate.

                    Apart from the international fees to study at the university, Fariya was determined to generate all her own income to pay for her studies and to survive in New Zealand. “My mum hated this, as I had money back in India. But I was adamant, so got a job at Pak‘n Save three nights a week. I would be at the counter, fill up, empty, and clean shelves, mop, sometimes deal with drunk customers on big events like Cup Day, and even clean up alcohol vomit. The job really shaped me as a person and changed how I valued all the people around me. It was like being washed from within.”

                    She remembers walking home one night after finishing work at 11pm, with two grocery bags in her hands, toes that felt broken, and looking up at the winter sky, studded with stars. “I said to the sky, ‘I’m here and I’m not going to give in.’ It was a lifechanging moment for me – when I was aware of something more, something bigger than life. I still get my power from moments like these.”

                    Desperately missing Sadat and Faraj, Fariya worked hard on gratitude and maintaining a positive mindset to get her through. “I would say to myself, I’m so grateful I have a child and he is safe and doing well. I didn’t attach myself to misery. I tried to change my brain chemistry all the time.”

                    Fariya quietly began to explore her Muslim faith in her new city, offering service to the small student mosque on Creyke Road, doing jobs like cleaning the toilets, and folding sheets, and spending time reflecting. She got lost on the way to visiting Al Noor Mosque one day, and after a long walk, finally arrived and burst into tears. “The people at the mosque were really kind to me, gave me a good cup of tea and said, ‘Why are you crying?’ I said it was because I am grateful and happy to be here.”

                    With a small budget of only around $40 for food some weeks, Fariya says her supermarket trolley would be filled with the white and blue ‘budget’ items. “My mother would ask if I was eating enough fruit, and I would say I was, even if I had eaten maybe one apple. What I did learn was how to appreciate the little I had.”

                    After six months in New Zealand, Sadat and Faraj came to visit. Fariya couldn’t bear for Faraj to go back to India, so she and Sadat agreed he would stay. “We ended up moving in with a wonderful Thai lady (Jackie Henricks), who became like an elder sister to me. She was my support person here, and I still have that connection with her.”

                    Faraj was six years old, and had to adjust to a very different way of life away from his family, friends and toys in India. “We would do simple things together, like visit the community garden and pick fruit and vegetables, paint stones, and pick up pinecones. I would message people about jobs on Student Job Search, saying I was going to be a teacher, and many of them were so kind. I did some babysitting work for a family who loved me to take Faraj, and have him eat with their children.”

                    Although she could have had financial help from her husband and mother, who between them spent a few months each year in New Zealand physically supporting her and Faraj, Fariya was determined to make it work on her own. “I didn’t think of the money. I was working towards something else – to being totally independent. Living this way was a learning and empowering experience for both Faraj and I.”

                    After she completed her Graduate Diploma of Teaching and Learning (Secondary), Fariya applied for around 100 jobs, and got mostly rejections back, but did land two interviews at Burnside High School, and Hornby High School, both schools she had done placements with during her course. Hornby High School offered her a fixed-term position as a Physics teacher, where she enjoyed the connectedness between the teachers and students.

                    At the end of the school year, Fariya asked Sadat, who was back in India, to help wade through all the education jobs on offer in Christchurch online, and only send her the ones relating to Physics. “A job came up at St Andrew’s College, and I said to Sadat, ‘Oh my gosh, this is a grand private school, would they take me?’ Sadat said ‘Why would you worry? Just go as you are and be yourself.’ I went to the interview, got the job, and my life changed again.”

                    Fariya started in the Science Department at St Andrew’s in 2015, still two years before Sadat was finally through his 20 years’ service in the army, and able to join her and Faraj in New Zealand permanently. “St Andrew’s was, and still is, such a supportive environment to be in, with amazing people who took care of me in a way. My Head of Department, Brent Cummack is a great leader. He allowed me to grow as an educator in various ways. Not only, attending professional development courses and maintaining a high level of teaching but attending and presenting at the National Physics Conference regularly.”

                    Fariya teaches NCEA Level 2 and 3 Physics, and aims to be a ‘teacher of excellence’, while bringing more students to Science, especially Physics. She started a Girls in Science Club at the College to encourage more girls into STEM subjects.

                    Her lifelong love of learning has continued alongside her teaching. In 2017, while on maternity leave with her baby daughter Elnaz, she did a Masters of Education paper on Inclusive Education, and has become passionate about inclusivity in teaching and learning practices.

                    “We decided to speak on Inclusion in January 2019 at the National Physics Conference, with a focus on how we can create a safe learning environment for all learners. Just two months later, the mosque attacks in Christchurch happened.”

                    Half an hour before the terrorist attack on 15 March 2019, Fariya was about to pick up a package near Al Noor Mosque, but decided to take Elnaz out of her car seat and go back inside the house to give her a bottle instead. “Something told me very strongly to do it.”

                    After the attack she went straight into ‘helper’ mode for her community for several months, before exhaustion took over and she gave herself time to work on her health and personal grief around the terrible events.

                    Fariya has been asked whether the terror attack played a part in her decision to start life coaching, and says this new journey has been forged from an amalgam of the many things she has been through in her life – including those early challenging experiences as a young girl in India, and her struggles for five-and-a-half years as a single mother, forging a better life for her family in New Zealand.

                    As a Professional Level Certified Life Coach, with ANZCAL (Australia and New Zealand Coaching Alliance) Fariya runs workshops and helps clients to set goals and achieve them. She also completed Brené Brown’s ‘Dare to Lead’ leadership programme, and has become a certified facilitator. In 2023, Fariya is taking a year’s sabbatical from St Andrew’s College to focus on her life coaching work, with a particular emphasis on leadership training.

                    Fariya believes that transformation happens when we are tested as human beings, as that’s when a metamorphosis often occurs. “If you consider yourself successful and you haven’t had a struggle, you should reconsider. I believe the harder we struggle, the more successful we can be.”

                    She and Sadat are very proud of their children. Faraj has grown into a humble, grounded, cultural and honest young leader, who will be a prefect in 2023, in his final year at Christchurch Boys’ High School. Elnaz has just turned five, and is very excited about starting school in the New Year.

                    Fariya said in a recent Facebook post that “Life is about risking everything for a dream that no one can see, but you.”

                    Not everyone has the courage to go after their dreams in the way Fariya has, but her inspirational story shows what can be possible with self-belief, determination, hard work and perhaps above all, gratitude for the journey. “It is the decisions, the calling, and the choices we make that define who we really become. What I have learned is that there is no end to the journey. There is only the journey. And the one thing that is constant on the journey is change.”

                    <b>Tracing her whakapapa</b>

                    It wasn’t until she was around 18 or 19 years old, that Giarne Harrison (Nō Ngāti Whātua tōkū iwi; Nō Ingarangi, nō Airani hoki ōku tupuna) discovered her Māori,heritage, and the pull to understand her whakapapa and immerse herself in the culture has been powerful ever since.
                    Over the last three decades, Giarne has been on a continuous journey of exploration. She is currently studying Level 3 te reo Māori, has become a teacher of raranga (weaving), and has pieced together information about her ancestors and their stories, although there are many unanswered questions. “I am still a bit adrift. I can’t name my maunga, awa, or hapū, but I’m trying to be happier about where I stand right now. The journey has helped me to claim all the parts of myself.”
                    Giarne was living in Sydney with her family when her mother first started to speak about her Māori ancestry. It wasn’t until the family moved back to New Zealand in 2001, settling in Christchurch, and Giarne began studying at Christchurch Teachers’ College, that her search for answers began in earnest. “There was a whānau class at the College, and I asked to go into that. When I was asked about my Māori background, I thought our family must be Tainui, because Mum grew up in Morrinsville. At that point I had only done a cursory search into who we were and ended up focusing on the wrong person. I had no concept of how to trace our whakapapa properly and mum didn’t know either.”
                    After making some discoveries and connecting with whānau in the North Island who were on a similar journey, Giarne was able to start putting together more information about her ancestor’s history. “We know very little about my grandmother from five generations back, Raihia Radford. However, it seems likely she ended up in Porirua. Her daughter Eliza boarded from the ages of five to 16 at St Joseph’s Providence Girls’ School, which was part of the Native School system, widespread throughout New Zealand in the mid 1880s.”
                    In a report presented to the Houses of the General Assembly in 1888, St Joseph’s was described as having a striking difference to some of the other schools, in that it was ‘stronger in English but weaker in most of the other subjects.’ It is clear from the report that a key purpose of these boarding schools was to assimilate Māori children into the European way of life. ‘In order that they may receive real training in the European mode of life and have the European customs and modes of thought engrafted into their nature, Māori children must for a time, live as Europeans.’
                    Once she left school, Eliza went to live with the Cooks, a well-known, Māori/English family from Foxton, most likely as a foster child or employee. The mother, Meretini Cook (born Te Akau), was a step granddaughter of Te Rauparaha, and he was said to have helped engineer her marriage to Thomas Uppadine Cook. They had 13 children and ran multiple businesses.
                    “We know that later Eliza married a baker, Thomas Brown in the Cook’s back yard. Apparently, she was asked to reclaim her lands, but didn’t understand what was being talked about. It appears there was a bankruptcy at some stage that caused issues between Eliza and the Cooks. We also know that in Eliza’s later life, in the early 1900s, she used to travel around and look after her grandchildren.”
                    As a wāhine of English, Irish, Spanish and Māori descent, Giarne understands the complexities of identity. She says it has been important for her to make peace with her Māori ancestors’ assimilation into European culture and the lack of information they have passed down. “I try to feel kindness rather than frustration towards them for assimilating into the dominant culture. I know things must have been tough for them, and they thought it would help them to have a successful life. A part of me still thinks ‘why didn’t you leave more information about where we came from?’
                    Back in her Teachers’ College days, Giarne says she often felt like an outsider in the whānau class but learnt so much from her classmates. “The immersion of sitting alongside people who had grown up
                    with whānau inside their whakapapa was my first experience of what it would have been like if we had grown up near our whānau. Most of the stuff I learned was through osmosis. I tried at least to be an ally, rather than part of the group. I learned a lot about myself and Te Ao Māori and started figuring out my place in it.”
                    Giarne began learning te reo Māori at Teachers College and has continued her studies at Te Wānanga O Aotearoa, and now with Whitiora (a Ngāi Tahu organisation) where she is currently up to Level 3.
                    During her university studies, Giarne was vice president, and then president of the Students Association at the Christchurch College of Education where she was a strong voice for Māori learners, and second chance learners. She later worked for the NZEI, New Zealand’s largest education union, a Treaty based organisation.
                    Around 10 years ago, Giarne started doing some raranga (weaving) courses, and took to it straight away. “I had never done it before, but it felt right. There is something about the whole sensory experience, the touch, smell, and being able to create something from harakeke. Weaving grounds me, connects me to my whakapapa, and grows my mind and spirit.”
                    Giarne later started teaching raranga and sharing weaving tips at regular workshops, while being constantly mindful of the traditions behind the craft. “I understand why there is a lot of protectionism around weaving. It is important to honour that and take the right steps while continually building more intricate knowledge.”
                    This year, Giarne has done fewer raranga workshops as her main focus has been her te reo Māori studies. She has also tried some new art projects, making clothing, as well as earrings, and even a kete from upcycled bicycle tyres.
                    In her day job, as a member of the support staff in the Art Department at Hillmorton High School, Giarne occasionally does weaving with students from the school, which have been extremely rewarding, she says. “The girls all turn up. They want to be there, which makes me realise why I’m doing it. Art or some kind of creative expression can be a real release.”
                    Giarne says her parents are supportive of her immersion into her Māori heritage, and she is excited by what is ahead in her ongoing journey of discovery.

                  <p>
                    Amanda Smidt vividly remembers her first day at primary school in South Africa, and how proud she was to put on her sparkling blue and white uniform and head off to school. From those earliest days, education became incredibly important to her. School was a place of learning but was also refuge from the turmoil of Amanda’s childhood years, which were spent living with a variety of wider family and friends, in a children’s home, and later being fostered by a wonderful foster family. “I felt othered because of my situation, and sometimes the teachers and other kids could be hard. But I remember the Primary School principal saying to me one day, “Mandy, just remember nobody can take your education away from you.”
                    She took his message to heart, and was soon helping other children who were not able to go to her school because of their colour. “I would run home every day down the dirt path, get some chalk, and write the lessons I had just learned on the wall. When I look back it was a revealing point in my life.”
                    Today, Amanda is a co-founder and careers counsellor at The Career Development Company, with a big part of her role being a passionate advocate for women entering the workforce. Unsurprisingly, given her early aptitude, Amanda started her own career journey as a teacher, but it has taken many twists and turns since.
                    Amanda came to New Zealand when she was 25, and taught at Tokoroa High School, Auckland Girls’ Grammar School, and Darfield High School. Alongside teaching, she often found herself in the role of careers counsellor or advisor at the schools. “While I was at Auckland Girls’ Grammar School I was asked to facilitate a Year 13 module called The World of Work, which I found really interesting. I also taught English to a group of Somali refugees at the school which was such a privilege. Those two strands, working with migrants, and the world of work, have continued to be important throughout my career.”
                    In 2005, Amanda decided to take a break from teaching, and was awarded a Teacher Fellowship with the Royal Society of New Zealand, with a lens on ‘technology in the real world’. She threw herself into the challenge, even working with roading crews to understand what it meant to work in that space, and going oversees to research apprenticeship schemes. This led to her being offered a full time job with the Infrastructure Industry Training Organisation as a training advisor and then as a qualifications and standards developer.
                    After some time with the ITO, and after the birth of her daughter, Marcella 10 years ago, Amanda started her own small careers consultancy business doing similar work. She realised she missed one-on-one connections with people and helping them to find tangible pathways into a career, so took the step to do her post graduate study in career development. While studying, she joined a volunteer group with the Careers Association (CDANZ) who were looking at developing professional standards for career practitioners in New Zealand.
                    Then over three years ago, she co-founded The CDC, a for-profit social enterprise, with three former colleagues and volunteers, including Dr Val O’Reilly, with whom her friendship dates back to Auckland Girls’ Grammar School days. “We genuinely care about what we do, and believe all people have the right to thrive in their work. Our idea was for The CDC to be impactful and purposeful, that we would find ways to sustain ourselves through the work we do, and also help others who can’t afford to pay a professional career practitioner.”
                    Amanda says entering the workforce, whether for the first time, or after a break, can be a daunting prospect for women, who still face some of the biggest challenges in this space. A lack of flexibility in the workplace, the gender pay gap, struggles with childcare and caregiving support, and unconscious bias are some of the common issues. “There is another layer of complexity again for migrant women. Whether they come to New Zealand as a skilled person with qualifications and experience, or no qualifications, they are often on the back foot the whole time, and really have to prove themselves. If migrant women do have qualifications, they may not be able to work in that field here without having their qualifications assessed and being asked to upskill. Then there is the bias they can face in the workplace, and cultural expectations across many migrant communities here, and around the world, about the importance of achieving the highest possible educational qualifications. It is a lot to negotiate.”
                    As a migrant woman herself, Amanda has a first-hand understanding of the challenges, and after spending half of her life in the workforce in New Zealand, is in the perfect position to bridge that gap.
                    She says it is definitely not all bad news. “If women gain clarity about themselves, their values, their career dreams, and set realistic actions to help bring their dreams to fruition, there is a way to find fulfilling work.”
                    This is the unique approach that Amanda and her colleagues at The CDC take during the ‘career conversations’ they have with clients who are seeking work. "When we start having career conversations, we always talk about peoples’ whole lives. What are all the things they have to think about, all the roles they have in their lives, and how do they impact? Personal values are another key consideration. If people make random decisions about work and don’t think about their value system, they could end up in a workplace where they feel stuck, and which isn’t congruent with their personal values. When that happens, issues can start arising.”
                    Expectations also sometimes have to be managed, she says. “Even people with degrees have to start their careers at an entry level point. I liken a first job to a bit like an apprenticeship. You learn how an industry works, meet the people in it, develop a work ethic, and build yourself up. It may not be a job that matches your skills and experience, but a move sideways is an important part of what I call the lattice approach – which is made up of life-long learning, and life-wide learning. If people can be open, vulnerable, feel the fear and just do it, so much learning can happen.”
                    Connections are another vital part of the employment process. The CDC team are constantly having conversations with employers and industry, and encouraging women to find ways to make and nurture new connections, and find their ‘tribe’.
                    Out of COVID-19 came The CDC’s Career Wayfinding project, which was funded to help migrant women into employment, a group hit hard by the pandemic. “We started with 10 women but ended up with 28, as there was such a need. The project followed the women on the entire journey from workshops to connections with employers. It finished last year and we are now trying to figure out how we can continue doing this important mahi.”
                    A funded, one day seminar to help professional migrant women find their way in the professional space is in the advanced planning stages. “This will be a lovely, rich day, which will help women to learn about and connect with local industry. We will be inviting employers into the space.”
                    Advocacy continues to be a key part of Amanda’s work. She still advises around careers in schools, has contributed to the Former Refugees, Recent Migrants and Ethnic Communities Employment Action Plan, the National Careers System, NZQA Skills Standards review, and is a member of the Canterbury Regional Leadership Skills Group,which has just launched the regional workforce plan, all of which have a focus on equity, diversity and inclusion within the system.
                    So where to now for this inspirational, dynamic wāhine?
                    “It’s always stirring in me how I can continue to help more people, especially migrant women who wouldn’t otherwise be able to access our services. It’s just a matter of being open to new ways of doing things. We can’t do this on our own but it’s incredible what we can do for our community in New Zealand when we work together.”
                    “I am also very much looking forward to heading back to South Africa with my daughter in October after seven-and-a-half years – to share with my daughter her South African heritage.”

                <div class="story-item-content" style="display: none;">
                  <p>
                    After coming to New Zealand from Singapore 10 years ago, Hana Saemon-Beck understands better than most some of the daunting challenges facing migrant women arriving in a new country. Along with navigating language and cultural differences, and making new friends, there can be the struggle to find work that matches the skills and education migrant women bring from their home countries.
                    One thing that helped to make Hana’s personal transition easier was the kindness of New Zealanders, she says. “I had only been to New Zealand once before with my parents in 2003 when I was a teenager. I thought the scenery was great but my general impression at the time was of endless green, sheep, and dead possums on the road. One thing I did take away was how kind Kiwis were and I still love that about New Zealand. As a migrant, Muslim Asian it can be hard to get to know other people, but the great thing about this country is there are so many opportunities for us to connect with each other, get to know each other and form this really multicultural society we want to see.”
                    Hana has a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) from Goldsmiths University of London, a Masters in Organisational Leadership from Monash University, and is in the final stages of studying towards a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) (Education) at University of Canterbury.
                    Her day job as a community activator for CityCare Property, sees her acting as a liaison between the company and communities in several different regions of New Zealand. She is also a passionate community volunteer, founding and leading two organisations which make a hugely positive impact.
                    In 2020, Hana started an English class for Nepalese women, which has since grown into the Aotearoa Multicultural Women Association (AMWA) which supports migrant women from all around the world who have settled in Ōtautahi Christchurch. “Gradually women from other countries joined the classes, which then evolved into regular socialisation sessions at the Hornby Community Centre. The staff there had identified there were a lot of migrant women in the area feeling very isolated, without the support of family from home. The Centre has been incredibly supportive, providing a base for AMWA.”
                    Hana single-handedly runs AMWA’s packed programme of events each month. These include weekly English classes, and weekly Coffee and Cake sessions, where migrant women often hear from guest speakers, including authors, or experts in things like employment skills and CVs. The group also has social outings, and earlier this month, ran a hugely popular henna workshop with Ami’s Henna and Beauty, with the support of the Hornby Community Centre, and AMWA’s major sponsor, Rotary Club of Hornby, which are both strong advocate’s for the group’s work. “I am honoured to be about to take up the position of International and Foundation Director for Hornby Rotary, as one of only four women, three under 40s, and the only non-Pakeha member of the club.”
                    Hana is proud of the barriers which AMWA has helped to break down over the last couple of years. “We have noticed that a lot of ethnic-based, or religious-based groups provide great support for each other within their own communities. However, AMWA brings people of all ethnicities and religions together, so we can understand each other, learn about each other’s cultures and respect each other. It is great seeing the friendships that have formed in the group. Many organise their own activities outside AMWA and some have even been on holiday together.”
                    Having doubts about living in a new country is perfectly normal, says Hana, who in 2018, was torn about whether to stay in New Zealand or go back to Singapore. Her way of dealing with it was to throw herself into a new activity – archery, a sport she had never tried before, but which is now a real passion. “I took a beginners course and loved it so much. I spent all my free time at the Christchurch Archery Club, and wasn’t afraid to plonk myself in the middle of the senior athletes. At the time I was the only Asian woman constantly interacting with the club, and because of my interest, I was elected to be part of the committee in my first year.”
                    She says the support of the club’s president was instrumental in her later becoming the club’s Diversity and Inclusivity Advisor, which has seen the makeup of the committee change significantly to be more diverse and to include more younger women.
                    Hana has since founded Aotearoa Adaptive Archery, another volunteer organisation, to support people with disabilities to take up archery. “New Zealand archer, Neroli Fairhall, who was the first paraplegic competitor in the Olympic Games, was from the Christchurch Archery Club. After she passed away in 2006, the focus on special needs’ archery wore off, so I took my idea to set up Aotearoa Adaptive Archery to the club president. I now work with various organisations including the Halberg Foundation, Parafed, and Blind Low Vision Education  Network New Zealand. I’ve coached five special needs individuals, one of whom won a medal in a New Zealand competition. It’s another very rewarding side hustle for me.”
                    Hana also sits on the board of Archery New Zealand, and has advocated for the implementation of visually impaired categories in national competitions.
                    Hana’s schedule can be eye-wateringly busy given she is juggling two community organisations alongside her full time work. Expanding the volunteer base for AMWA is one of her goals moving forward, she says. “I would love some of the migrant women in our group to be brave enough to take on the opportunity to volunteer and run some of our programmes. The skill sets they develop such as stakeholder engagement, event management and marketing, can all be put into their CV, and will help when they are looking for jobs.”
                    Regardless of where we are from, Hana says a warm welcome and kindness never go amiss. “We all have far more similarities than we do differences, and that is what I want people to see. This is only possible when we connect with other. That’s my dream.”

                    Although she may not be as well-known as Kate Sheppard and the other suffragists from the late 1800s, another inspiring wāhine from this era is Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia (22 May 1868 – 10 October 1920) who was also a campaigner for women's suffrage, and inspired future generations of Māori women.
                    In 1893, she became the first recorded women in New Zealand to address Te Kotahitanga, the Māori parliament, speaking on her motion requesting that Māori women be given the right to vote and be eligible to sit in the Māori parliament.
                    Meri Te Tai is said to have been born on 22 May 1868, near Whakarapa (Panguru) on the Hokianga Harbour. Her great-grandmother was woman of mana, Ngākahuwhero, and her father, Rē Te Tai, was an influential chief of Te Rarawa in the Hokianga district.
                    She is said to have been well-educated, studying at St Mary's Convent in Auckland, and she was an accomplished pianist. In the late 1880s or early 1890s she became the third wife of Hāmiora Mangakāhia, of Ngāti Whanaunga and other Coromandel hapū. He was an assessor in the Native Land Court, and was working at Waimate North in 1887. He was also at the Bay of Islands in 1889, attending the meeting at which Te Kotahitanga, the Māori parliament movement, was formally initiated.
                    Hāmiora Mangakāhia was elected premier of the Kotahitanga parliament in June 1892. In 1893 both he and Meri attended the second session of the parliament at Waipatu in Hawke's Bay. The women's suffrage movement had been gaining strength from the 1880s, and it is likely that Meri had knowledge of this. She may, like many Māori women, have come into contact with the New Zealand Women's Christian Temperance Union, which campaigned for women's suffrage. On 18 May 1893 the Speaker of the lower house of the Kotahitanga parliament introduced a motion from Meri Mangakāhia, requesting that women be given the right to participate in the selection of members. It was suggested that she come into the house to explain her motion, and later that day she addressed the parliament – the first woman recorded to have done so.
                    She requested not only that Māori women be given the vote, but that they be eligible to sit in the Māori parliament, thus going a step further than the contemporary aims of the European suffrage movement. She argued on the grounds that many Māori women owned and administered their own lands, either because they had no male relatives or because the women were more competent. She claimed that although chiefs had appealed to Queen Victoria over Māori problems, Māori women had received no advantage from these appeals, and suggested that the Queen might more readily respond to representations by women.
                    Meri was followed in the debate by Ākenehi Tomoana, wife of Hēnare Tomoana, the host at Waipatu. Ākenehi suggested that discussion of the issue be postponed until the men had 'achieved their goal' – until, she appears to have meant, they had succeeded in achieving recognition for the Kotahitanga parliament. The matter then lapsed.
                    Little further is recorded of Meri Mangakāhia's participation in the Kotahitanga movement, but she continued to be active in Māori politics and welfare. An oil portrait painted about this time, preserved by her family, shows a beautiful young woman dressed in the height of European fashion. It is likely that she was a member of one of the women's committees of the Kotahitanga movement. These committees, early forerunners of the Māori Women's Welfare League, organised the activities of young people attending Kotahitanga meetings, and undertook massive catering. They also held meetings and debated political issues.
                    Meri and Hāmiora Mangakāhia spent most of their last years together at Whangapoua. Hāmiora died in June 1918, and Meri died of influenza on 10 October 1920, aged 52. She was buried at Pūreirei cemetery, Lower Waihou, near her father.

                  Multi-talented freelance mural artist, illustrator and graphic designer Kophie Su’a Hulsbosch on her art, inspirations, and environmental and social conscience.
                </div>

                <div class="story-item-content" style="display: none;">
                  <p>
                    When multi-talented artist, Kophie Su’a-Hulsbosch, was around 11 or 12 years old, she moved to the bright lights of Ōtautahi Christchurch from a rural upbringing in Wanaka and was immediately captivated by the city’s thriving graffiti scene. “I had never been to Christchurch or any city before apart from Dunedin and was blown away by the creativity and rebellious aspect of graffiti. I started doing it in my books and practised at the train tracks and in the city. As I got older, I got better and better at it.”
                    The earthquakes destroyed much of the city’s graffiti from the early 2000s, but some of Kophie’s work is still visible behind broken walls or in alleyways. Being one of few girls on the scene back then wasn’t easy, she says. “I’ve been the target of abuse, but that didn’t stop me. I did it for me.”
                    Her work has always had a strong environmental, social and political conscience, she says. “I used to go to the library and read heaps of books on graffiti and political street art on places like the Berlin Wall and Palestine Wall. I was inspired by subversive art and would stick big posters up in my room. I’ve continued to evolve from there.”
                    After starting out as the only female in the local graffiti scene, today Kophie, (aka Meep) is a sought-after freelance mural artist, illustrator, and graphic designer. Recently, she was one of seven New Zealand inspiring artists to headline the FLARE Street Art Festival, which had a goal of helping to cement Christchurch as a global street art capital.
                    Her vibrant, eyecatching mural, featuring a colourful headphone wearing girl, transformed a huge 15m x 11m wall in The Welder carpark on St Asaph Street. The theme of this piece was a departure from her more usual political or environmentally charged works. “It’s probably my favourite piece so far. It’s the biggest mural I’ve done and I’m really happy with the concept. FLARE gave us total creative freedom, which is so important for this sort of work.”
                    Kophie was also curator of the festival’s pop-up gallery, which showcased other works of the headline artists, along with Ōtautahi graffiti and street artists. She loves the way the city has embraced street art, especially post-earthquakes. “People are commissioning artwork and more artists can make a living off it. It’s awesome to see the vibrancy and creativity around the city.”
                    After being inspired by the graffiti on the Berlin Wall when she was younger, Kophie was excited to have the opportunity to create a mural on an actual piece of the wall, which has found a new home in Cashel Street. “One of my good friends is from Berlin, and she said when the wall fell that Berlin had one of the greatest street parties in history. I wanted the mural to reflect that, with the colours bright and clashing to represent freedom and the love of people reuniting.”
                    Sustainable fashion is another area where Kophie has channelled her creativity. While completing her post graduate degree (First Class Honours in Bachelor of Media Arts), Kophie’s year-long project was to create a sustainable streetwear brand and jewellery line, Future Apparel. Appalled by the environmental and ethical impacts of the fast fashion industry and its over consumption, Kophie combined everything she knew about hip hop culture, skateboard fashion, repurposing clothing, sustainability, and her love for op shopping, into the project. “I did lots of research about the circular economy and sustainable fabrics, but in the end, thought the most sustainable thing to do was to re-use and reimagine recyclable clothing and objects that are already here.”
                    With three friends, she was also co-founder, sustainability advisor and creative director for the Conscious Cub, which before they went into hiatus recently, educated and inspired many people in the city through a series of sustainable, ethical events.
                    In her day job as a graphic artist, Kophie regularly works with a number of hip-hop artists, and continues to create imagery and branding for many high-profile local clients.
                    With her mixed Dutch and Samoan heritage, she says exploring her identity is becoming increasingly important, both personally and in her work. “I grew up with my mum and my Dutch side in Wanaka and am learning more about my Samoan heritage from my Dad and a good friend who is half Samoan as well. We are attending things together, and what I’m learning is influencing my work more and more.”
                    Given she is such a passionate advocate for environmental and social change, Kophie says art is a powerful medium in which to share her messages. “Almost no one wants to read a big report on this stuff or listen to me lecturing them all the time. The beauty of the work is that it can share quite complex messages in picture form and start meaningful conversations.”

                  Easter recipe – Lemon Biscuits

                <div class="story-item-intro">

                  <p>
                    With Easter weekend upon us, we asked Ninotchka (Nin) McKay, a post graduate student from St Martins, to share why Easter is her favourite Christian holiday. Nin has also kindly provided a recipe for Lemon Biscuits, which she loves to make and decorate in an Easter theme, with her two children Isla (13) and Asher (5) who are pictured, having fun with lots of creative designs. “We all enjoy a good Easter egg hunt, and plenty of chocolate, but Easter is also a bittersweet time. It can be hard to translate the message behind this week for children without terrifying them. However I think it can be comforting for kids to pray to a Jesus who understands what it’s like to be misunderstood, teased or jeered on the playground, and it helps to set some context for all the ‘unfair’ stuff happening in the world right now.”
                    Nin says the key message of Easter, that God’s overwhelming, undeniable love for his people is so big that he would sacrifice his son, then resurrect him with the promise of eternal life to all who follow him, is a powerful message that can help when the world feels broken. “I guess that’s why Easter features chickens and eggs – the idea of new life and a new start. Self-reflection and asking for forgiveness when you get it wrong is another hopeful and accessible message for anyone young or old.”

                    <b>Lemon Biscuits</b>
                    This biscuit is a great Easter recipe to make with children, and is perfect for everything from school lunches to elegant high tea.
                    - 100g Butter (room temperature)
                    - ½ teaspoon salt
                    - Zest of a small lemon
                    - 1 cup sugar
                    - 1 egg
                    - 2 tablespoons milk
                    - 2 cups of flour
                    - 1 teaspoon baking powder
                    - ½ teaspoon baking soda

                    Preheat oven to 180oC (not fan forced).
                    Line two cookie sheets with non-stick baking paper.
                    Cream first four ingredients until pale and fluffy. (A stand mixer is great if you have it)
                    Whisk together milk and egg.  Sift dry ingredients.
                    Add milk/egg mixture in three batches, along with a teaspoon of the sifted dry ingredients each time (this is so the mixture doesn’t split).  Mix well after each addition.
                    Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix until a soft dough forms.  Be aware that mixing too much at this stage will give you a ‘tough’ biscuit.  I prefer to do this stage by hand.  Dump out the dough onto a floured surface – it doesn’t matter if you have some dried ingredients not quite mixed at the bottom of the bowl. Form it together into a flat-ish ball.  Using clingfilm or baking paper, wrap the dough and chill it in the fridge for about 10-15 mins.
                    When your dough is chilled, roll it out to around 1cm thick and cut out biscuit shapes.  If you don’t have a cutter, you could roll it into a sausage shape and cut slices to form your biscuits.
                    Bake for 8-10mins until lightly golden and cool completely before adding your decorations.
                    We used a ‘writing icing’ pack with several small coloured pre-mixed icings from the supermarket, hundreds and thousands and mini marshmallows to create their easter themed biscuits.  These are lovely just plain in lunchboxes or they are a brilliant ‘dunker’ with a hot drink.

                  <p>
                    A random post on Facebook around 18 month ago, sparked an idea which has resulted in good friends Louisa Stewart and Kim Steetskamp setting up Clothed in Love, which has already provided packs of free, good quality preloved or new clothing to hundreds of children in need in Ōtautahi Christchurch, says Louisa. “We saw a post about a pre-school looking for jackets and shoes for kids who needed them. My husband said, surely there is something we can do?”
                    Louisa knew her friend Kim had a soon to be empty space on her large property, and approached her with an idea to create a clothing bank, to streamline the process between parents who had children’s clothing they would like to pass on, and families who needed them. “Kim said she and her husband Scott could give me a 20 foot container to use, but she wasn’t sure she would have the time to help. Famous last words!”
                    The women started collecting pre-loved clothing for children aged 0–16 years from donors across the city, and set up a Facebook page where families/whanau in need, or organisations, could apply for a clothing pack for their child or children. Most packs include everything from underwear, socks, pyjamas, and swimming togs, to tops, pants, shorts, skirts, dresses, and even jackets and gumboots. “Our packs are a gift of love, and are never a handout,” says Louisa.
                    Last year Clothed in Love put together 710 packs for children in the Christchurch, Selwyn and North Canterbury areas. With the current economic pressures, demand is already outstripping that in 2022, says Louisa. “At the end of February, I sent a bulk email out to all the Decile 1–8 schools in Christchurch, and within three days we had requests for clothing packs for 250 children. In March and April to date we have already delivered an incredible 362 packs, which is over half of what we sent out in the whole of last year.”
                    Over the last 18 months, Clothed in Love has grown from two women with a great idea and an impressive work ethic, to a registered charitable organisation, with a Board, a team of 80 active volunteers, and an extra 40 foot container to run their operation. “Our wonderful volunteers are split into teams – those who open their homes as drop off points for donations; our sorting and packing teams who operate from our Yaldhurst base at different times over a month; our courier team who donate their time and petrol to pick up donations and deliver packs; and our washing team, who gift their time and washing machines to ensure the donations are good to go. Some incredible businesses have also come on board to help us, and we have built key relationships with support organisations and schools across Christchurch who do great mahi with families and children.”
                    Clothed in Love also accepts monetary donations, which are put towards things like new underwear, socks, and other items in short supply, as well as running costs. Their new website goes live soon.
                    The organisation’s generosity has many benefits. As well as helping to relieve financial and emotional pressure for families/whanau, Clothed in Love helps to reduce the carbon footprint by repurposing clothing which may have otherwise been destined for landfill.
                    Between them, Louisa and Kim have six children, so understand the pressures of caring for a growing family. Louisa says they have been friends for a few years and their different personalities are a strength. “Kim is our day-to-day person, she loves to be out in the container with our folding and sorting teams. My role is more around strategies and systems, and ensuring our teams are running smoothly.”
                    Louisa and Kim and their families have strong faith, with the name Clothed in Love, inspired by a proverb in the Bible – “Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us together in perfect harmony.” (Colossians 3:14).
                    “We know we are reaching out to a community which will differ in belief, faith, family makeup, life choices, and backgrounds, however we are sure we all share one thing in common – the importance of loving others. Clothed in Love is focused on loving those who are perhaps the most vulnerable, our children. However in loving them, we are also loving their families, their friends and their communities.”

                    Yellow was Sayyad Ahmad Milne’s favourite colour, and, since his tragic passing in the terror attack on 15 March 2019, it has become a symbol to honour him. Many young players wore yellow in memory of Sayyad at a futsal tournament for youth, organised by his mother Noraini, exactly three years on from that terrible day, to pay tribute to the young Shuhada (martyrs) who lost their lives.
                    The colour yellow evokes a sunny, bright, youthful energy which perfectly describes Sayyad, a football mad 14-year-old, who dreamed of becoming a professional footballer. Early in March 2019, he was looking forward to a futsal tournament in Wellington with his Cashmere High School team. Noraini told him on the morning of 15 March, that his tickets to Wellington were booked. Sadly, he never made it.
                    Noraini was also at Al Noor Mosque during the attack, hiding from the gunman in another room. It is incomprehensible to imagine what she and the other impacted members of the Muslim community have gone through.
                    Early on, and in honour of the heartbreaking loss of Sayyad, Noraini decided she was going to embark on a healing journey, and to continue to do good works in the world. At the court hearing, before the gunman’s sentencing, she bravely told him, “My survival comes as a great blessing and when I reflect on that day, I have decided I will live my life doing great things for our people, our community.”
                    Noraini has been true to her word. She has continued to empower young people, and their families, through Active Muslim Explorers, a group founded in 2016 which has regular retreats that provide physical and spiritual activities, with a focus on developing leadership skills.
                    Her latest initiative is called Sow a LYTTEL Seed, which she has founded with the support of her neighbours Cathy Lum-Webb and Crile Doscher. The group’s purpose is to bring people together from in and around Lyttelton and seed opportunities for healing, growth and well-being. “Sow a LYTTEL Seed was founded to represent our Sayyad’s legacy, consisting of kindness, empathy, love and hope, and what 15 March 2019 means to us. The aroha and support we received from the wider community and especially people in the Lyttelton community, has been overwhelming, and this is a way of giving back. I’m so grateful for the help of Cathy and Crile who have been selfless with their time and are dear friends as well as neighbours.”
                    With no official events held to mark the third anniversary of the attack, Noraini and Sow a LYTTEL Seed partnered with a number of different organisations to run community-led activities as part of Unity Week, organised by the Sakinah Community Trust, to promote unity, peace, and encourage support for the Muslim community. “As well as honouring the 51 Shuhada, the events were about celebrating diversity and inclusion and showing gratitude for the support we received – so many things.”
                    The first event called ‘Healing Hearts & Growing Together’ on Monday 14 March, was run in conjunction with Beck Parnham and Giving Seeds of Love. This was a lovely opportunity for women to come together, make seeded hearts infused with wildflowers with the help of Beck, reflect on everyone’s journey over the last three years, and talk about what the future could be.
                    On Tuesday 15 March, Sow a LYTTEL Seed partnered with Mainland Football, Canterbury Cricket, Ferrymead Bays Football Club and Lyttelton Primary School, to run a 5-aside memorial futsal tournament at the Lyttelton Recreation Centre. Shirts in various colours with names of the young Shuhada were worn by the players representing the young lives lost on the day - Mucaad Ibrahim, 3. Sayyad Milne, 14. Hamza Mustafa, 16. Muhammad Haziq bin Mohd Tarmiz. 17, Talha Naeem, 21 and Tariq Omar, 24, who all had a love of football. “It was a pleasure working with Hussain Hanif, Diversity and Inclusion Manager for Canterbury Cricket and Mainland Football on this initiative, and we look forward to many more collaborations with both of these organisations to promote sports as platform to celebrate diversity and holistically enhance youth well-being,” said Noraini.
                    After recently completing his epic walk for peace and unity from Dunedin to Christchurch, Temel Atacocugu, who was shot nine times in the attack, gave an inspirational speech to the youth after the futsal tournament about the future of peace and unity through the next generation.
                    On Thursday 17 March, Sow a LYTTEL Seed, Giving Seeds of Love, and Active Muslim Explorers organised a very special event at New Brighton Pier, where a stunning artwork, designed by Sudi Dargipour, was created in the sand by Wayne Webb, with the help of Temel Atacocugu. This event was generously supported by Sakinah Community Trust, Ōtautahi Creative Spaces and Purapura Whetu. The inspiration for this project came from a series of workshops by Janneth Gil as part of her Darkness into Light project, which uses art as therapy for women.
                    Sow a LYTTEL Seed is considering future events, which may include embroidery classes, walking football games, and a volleyball tournament for women.
                    The group’s logo has deep meaning for Noraini, with the circle representing togetherness and strength, the Arabic calligraphy a reminder of Noraini’s Muslim background, the word Shifaa meaning healing, and the colours green, representing Islam, and of course yellow, Sayyad’s favourite colour. “The name, Sow a LYTTEL Seed was inspired by a quote on a plaque that we installed alongside the 51 trees that were planted at Pony Point Reserve in honour of those lost, which reads ‘When you sow a seed of kindness and empathy it grows into 51 trees of love and hope.”
                    With the seeds of opportunity that Noraini is planting in her local communities and beyond, some very tall, strong trees of love, hope, kindness and empathy, in honour of her beautiful son, and all those lost, are sure to grow. “Helping people to heal is one of the most important aspects of Sow a LYTTEL Seed. There are lots of broken-hearted people, and people in pain, and while it is good to talk about peace and unity, we can’t truly have this unless we are healed. I’m not shy but I sometimes find it hard to put things into words, which is why I am more of an action person. Our Sow a LYTTEL Seed events are a great way to bring our community together, but they also provide a space where people can talk to someone and get things off their chest. We want to contribute to peoples’ healing, well-being and growth. InshaAllah.”

                  A voice from the past – suffragist Kate Sheppard

                <div class="story-item-intro">
                  Renowned suffragist Kate Sheppard's legacy continues to impact women over 120 years after New Zealand women got the vote. Just who was Kate Sheppard?

                  <p>
                    It is easy to be moved when standing in the tasteful dining room at Te Whare Waiutuutu Kate Sheppard House, imagining the spirit of Kate Sheppard, the other suffragists, and leading figures for women’s rights who gathered there to plot, plan and create what proved to be the epicentre of the women’s global suffrage movement.
                    We can also only imagine the joy, pride, and likely some relief, Kate must have felt when she was in her garden on 19 September 1893 and received the telegram advising her that women had finally had won the right to vote in New Zealand. The arduous five-year nationwide campaign she had led, had finally achieved its goal, against fierce opposition.
                    So who was Kate Sheppard?
                    The well-known images of Kate evoke a genteel, beautifully dressed, middle class Victorian woman, which was true of her position in Christchurch society in the late 1800s. However, it was her challenging early years in the United Kingdom which really forged her character and strong sense of social justice.
                    Kate was born in Liverpool in 1847, to Andrew and Jemima Malcolm, who both had Scottish heritage. The family moved around a lot, eventually to London, where when Kate was just four years old, her father disappeared from their lives forever. The family always said he died 10 years later in Dublin, when in fact he had sailed to New York to join the US Army. He died of delirium tremens in New Mexico in 1862, but the family never breathed a word of the secret.
                    Andrew had left the family one step away from homelessness, so Kate was sent to live with her maternal aunt and uncle, William Barclay, who was a Minister with the independent Free Church. With them, Kate gained a good education and developed a sense of standing up for things that weren’t right.
                    Kate migrated to New Zealand aged 20. Her sister Marie had married drapery merchant, George Beath, who set up Beath’s Department Store in Christchurch. Kate married George’s friend, Walter Sheppard in 1871. George Beath paid for his wife’s family to sail to New Zealand first class. Kate and Walter’s only child, a son Douglas was born in 1880.
                    In 1885, the Women’s Christian Temperance Movement hit New Zealand, when Mary Leavitt arrived from the United States to lecture New Zealand women about prohibition of alcohol. Kate signed up and was soon the National Superintendent of Franchise and Legislation, which included questioning laws around women. This was the beginning of her work as a suffragist.
                    During the important campaign years from 1888 to 1893, Kate was living at the Clyde Road house, busily writing articles and letters, organising and sending out pamphlets, preparing speeches, lobbying members of parliament and directing other suffragists and women’s organisations throughout New Zealand.
                    It was around Kate’s dining table that the third, and ultimately successful, large petition, consisting of 31,872 signatures gathered from women all around New Zealand, was pasted onto a large roll by Kate and other suffragists, and sent to the House of Representatives in Wellington. Their victory was a world-first achievement and led to many other women around the world gaining the right to vote. The New Zealand suffragists also wanted women to be able to get into Parliament so they could start making social reforms for women and children.
                    Kate was known as a very good speaker, who would gently win her arguments through humour and using her intelligence. She was able to rally people and get them on board. She was also a fashionista, whose weakness was beautiful clothes.
                    In 1902, nine years after the vote for women was won, Kate and Walter Sheppard decided to sell their Clyde Road house and return to England. Walter travelled with their son, Douglas, while Kate took an apartment in the centre of Christchurch before leaving in 1903. Kate’s health deteriorated, and on medical advice she returned to Christchurch, amicably parting with Walter, and living with her great friends, William and Jennie Lovell-Smith. Kate had largely retired from public speaking and activism by this time apart from writing and later supporting suffragists in the United Kingdom.
                    Tragedy struck in 1910, when her son Douglas died of pernicious anaemia at the age of just 29, followed by her only grandchild, Margaret at the age of 21 in 1930.
                    Kate married William Lovell-Smith in 1925, a year after he was widowed. In 1933, a year before Kate passed away, Elizabeth McCombs of Lyttelton, became the first women elected to Parliament. It had been Kate’s hope that women would eventually be represented in Parliament, so it was wonderful she saw it happen in her lifetime and her legacy came full circle.

                <div class="story-item-intro">
                  New UCW ‘crew’ member Suhayla Asghari joined us for our Welcome Pack initiative and has her own amazing story of arriving in New Zealand as an Afghan refugee.

                    When Suhayla Asghari arrived in New Zealand as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2004, she was an 11-year-old girl who spoke little English, and had already survived life-threatening situations, including capture by the Taliban.
                    It was difficult for Suhayla to adapt to life in New Zealand in the beginning, and she found it difficult to communicate with her classmates. It took two years before she started to feel comfortable here.
                    Since those early days, Suhayla found her wings and thrived, getting her degree and achieving a Master of Social Work from the University of Canterbury. She currently works at Māori health and social services organisation Purapura Whetu as a Wellbeing Practitioner, tirelessly supporting the Muslim community.
                    Co-founder of Uniting Canterbury Women, Dr Hafsa Ahmed has written a wonderful profile of Suhayla for her series ‘Unquiet Women’ about Asian women who have migrated to New Zealand, and which is supported by the Asia Media Centre.

                    When Uniting Canterbury Women was organising our inaugural event in 2019, we thought it might be nice to include a small Linden Leaves product in the gift packs we were planning to give to each woman who came to the event. So we reached out to Brigit Blair, founder of the internationally renowned Christchurch company to see what we could purchase with our very small budget.
                    We were certainly not counting on Brigit’s incredible generosity. The gift packs we gave out that night became the stuff of legend, as they included not one, but four, beautiful full-sized Linden Leaves products.
                    We love having Brigit as such a wonderful supporter of Uniting Canterbury Women and are inspired by her incredible business success story. Did you know that Brigit founded Linden Leaves in her kitchen in 1995, after struggling to find natural and effective skincare for her children, who suffered from severe eczema and allergies? She started hand-making her own beautiful and effective natural products, using oils and the best ingredients.
                    From these humble beginnings, Linden Leaves has grown into a thriving international brand, which has won numerous awards, both in New Zealand, and globally for its luxury, handmade natural skincare, body care and beautiful scented products for the home, which are now available in nine countries.
                    We were delighted to have Brigit as our very first online ‘Dinner Club’ guest in July 2020, when she provided a fascinating insight into her inspiring story. She also shared some important wellbeing tips, and advice for thriving in life and business in the COVID-19 world.

                <div class="story-item-intro">
                  The story of the real ‘Nurse Maude’ and her incredible legacy is truly fascinating. She was a genuine trailblazer.

                  <p>
                    Most of us would have seen the Nurse Maude cars zipping around Christchurch, driven by caring district nurses and palliative care nurses doing amazing work in our community.
                    Did you now that the wonderful work of the ‘original’ Nurse Maude – a Christchurch nurse named Sibylla Emily Maude, led to the birth of district nursing in Christchurch and around New Zealand?
                    Born in 1862, the eldest of eight children, Sibylla grew up in a deeply religious Anglican family. The example set by her father, who was at the time of her birth, Provincial Secretary, and two of her aunts who were nurses appears to have inspired in her a desire to help other people.
                    She rose to the role of matron of Christchurch Hospital by 1893 but left that role in 1896 to begin the work for which she was most remembered – caring for the old, infirm and poor in their own homes.
                    Nurse Maude got financial backing to undertake district nursing in the city, and established a headquarters in Durham Street, which served as a dispensary and a place where minor ailments were treated. In 1901, the District Nursing Association was founded to support the work.
                    Dressed in a light-blue uniform and white apron with dark-blue cape and bonnet, Nurse Maude walked many miles every day in all weathers, carrying not only nursing equipment but often the pans for cooking, cleaning and washing which many people lacked. She tried to teach her patients the importance of cleanliness and fresh air, and as a woman of prayer she invariably prayed with them.
                    More nurses joined – and a horse and cart and bicycles were provided to transport them.
                    Nurse Maude opened two sanitoriums for tuberculosis in Christchurch and during the influenza epidemic which started in 1918, was put in charge of the central bureau to coordinate the nursing of influenza victims in the city. In the difficult 1920s she opened a soup kitchen for undernourished children.
                    Nurse Maude never married and died on 12 July 1935. Her funeral was attended by large crowds who came to pay tribute to the most celebrated women in the city at the time.
                    She was greatly respected and loved for her genuine practical sympathy for the poor and her complete integrity. Thanks to the impact of her work, district nursing was developed throughout the country.
