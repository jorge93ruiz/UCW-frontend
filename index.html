                  <p>Uniting Canterbury Women was devasted to hear about the plight of the evacuees who fled Afghanistan to New Zealand at the end of August to escape the brutal new Taliban regime. Many men, women and children went through an incredibly traumatic time to get here and arrived with little more than the clothes on their backs. 
                  We were determined to do something to help, so started a Givealittle campaign to raise money to create individual Welcome Packs for the evacuees at the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre. This was a cause especially close to our hearts, as two of our current crew members, Zahra Hussaini, and Suhayla Asghari are former refugees from Afghanistan. They both spent time at the Centre on their arrival to New Zealand, and never forgot the kindnesses they received.
                  We easily surpassed our goal to raise $11,000 – reaching over $14,000 in the end thanks to great support from Kiwi donors. Our campaign also attracted the support of generous social enterprises and businesses who either donated goods for the packs, or offered wholesale prices or less. Even former Prime Minister, Helen Clark got behind the Givealittle campaign, mentioning it almost daily on her social media platforms, and there was a story on 1News at Midday talking about the initiative. 
                  In early October, with the help of some awesome women, we packaged up around 250 very special Welcome Packs, filled with items that would introduce the evacuees to their new country, and also remind them of home. The packs included fragrant spices, saffron, and tea which was specially blended by Zahra.
                  The women were gifted beautiful silk krama (scarves) handwoven in Cambodia, Linden Leaves products and TradeAid bags, among many other items, while prayer mats, woollen hats and thermos flasks were among the items in the men's packs.
                  We were so excited to hear that the packs arrived in Auckland, and can’t wait for the feedback from the Centre.

              Tea for Three – May 2022  
            </div>
            <p>
              We were buzzing after our inaugural Tea for Three event in early May. Thanks so much to the fabulous women who joined us for this fun evening of connection and conversations. Tea for Three is an online event, with a super simple format. We randomly split the main group into groups of three in separate 'Zoom rooms' with some fun starter questions to break the ice and prompt a 15-minute conversation. The women had three conversations during the evening, and we all came back to the main room at the end. It was such a great event that we have decided to create a ‘Winter Series’ of Tea for Three online events, which will culminate in an in-person Tea for Three event for all who attended an online session, giving them the chance to meet their new friends in person.

              UCW Writing Life Stories Your Way Workshop – March 2022 
            </div>
            <p>
              In March, UCW co-founder Jo Bailey, ran a Writing Life Stories Your Way Workshop for a group of predominantly Muslim women, to help them to get their stories onto the page. Alongside the learning, it was a wonderful session of sharing, with some incredible stories told at the event, which was held at Te Whare Waiutuutu Kate Sheppard House. We can’t wait to hear about the women’s future storytelling progress!

              UCW hosts Narrative 4 – February 2022 
            </div>
            <p>
              In February, we were delighted to help Shannon Malik and Steffi Brightwell of Narrative 4 launch the Christchurch branch of the story exchange organisation at Te Whare Waiutuutu Kate Sheppard House. The House was the perfect, private, peaceful setting for our wahine to dive deep, be vulnerable and share some incredible stories about a moment in their lives when they felt powerful. A big thank you to Shannon and Steffi for creating a safe space and guiding us through the process, which really helped us all to build confidence and empathy, and to hold the space for another wahine's story, which was then shared with the group. It was very powerful, and we had an insightful debrief at the end about the many positives we took from the day.

              Around the World in Eight Cafes – Five Star Vietnamese Restaurant – November 2021 
            </div>
            <p>
              There was so much chatter and amazing energy at our Around the World in Eight Cafes event at Five Star Vietnamese Restaurant, on 19 November 2021. We tried to seat women alongside people they don't know to encourage new friendships. We placed some 'connection' questions on each of the tables, but the conversations were so instant the questions were really not needed. Thanks again to Gina Satterthwaite and the Fife Foundation for supporting this event, and Li from Five Star Vietnamese Restaurant for her amazing hosting and delicious food (definitely worth five stars). We also enjoyed hearing from Li's daughter, Hannah, who gave us a great short talk about Vietnamese food and their family restaurant (at Fendalton Village Mall) which we highly recommend visiting!

            Around the World in Eight Cafes
          </div>
          <p>
            Uniting Canterbury Women hosts coffee and food catch ups for women from all cultures and ethnicities in Christchurch. Each time, the groups meet at a different ethnic café, to connect, share stories, share food, and learn new things about the food and culture from the café owner. Not only is it a great way to connect women, we also learn about different cuisines and cultures, and support small local ethnic businesses. It’s a win win!
          </p>
          <p>
            We are grateful to The Christchurch Foundation, and Fife Foundation, for their support of our Around the World in Eight Cafes initiative.

                Uniting Canterbury Women was founded after the tragic terror attack in Christchurch on 15 March 2019.
              </p>
              <p>
                Co-founder, Jo Bailey reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to talk about how to continue on the beautiful love and support for the Muslim community being shown by people in Canterbury and New Zealand, and Uniting Canterbury Women was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zahra introduced Jo to four of her friends, Rebecca Parnham, Dr Hafsa Ahmed, Amber Johnson, and Naeema Masud. The six women bonded over coffee and cake, and together, organised the inaugural Uniting Canterbury Women event, which was attended by nearly 600 women.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Jo Bailey and Rebecca Parnham continue to lead Uniting Canterbury Women and organise a range of events to connect wāhine across all cultures. They are supported by the rest of the UCW team, and new crew member, Suhayla Asghari, when they are available to assist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uniting Canterbury Women has a popular Facebook page with over 1250 followers. Zahra Hussaini runs the group's thriving Instagram page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many incredible connections and friendships have been made and continue to be made across the Uniting Canterbury Women community.

                The original Uniting Canterbury Women crew were delighted to reunite to work on the Welcome Pack project for the Afghan evacuees. They were joined by new crew member, Suhayla Asghari, who filled the spot left by Naeema Masud, who now lives in Sydney.

                    Jo Bailey is a writer, editor, author, publisher, and social change activist, who believes in kindness, celebrating our diversity, and equality for all. Uniting Canterbury Women was created after Jo had the idea to run an event for women, to carry on the feelings of connection and compassion for our Muslim community after the tragic events of 15 March 2019. She reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to chat about the idea, and thanks to Zahra’s amazing connections, UCW was born. Jo continues to co-lead UCW alongside Rebecca Parnham. She is a passionate storyteller, journalist and freelance writer and editor, and is the author of four books. Jo is also an accomplished public speaker, and teaches people how to write their own or family stories during her Writing Life Stories Your Way workshops. She is also the proud mum or two gorgeous grown-ups.

                    Rebecca Parnham has energy to burn and comes up with lots of amazing ideas, that UCW often bring to life. As well as being a mum to two gorgeous girls, Rebecca is passionate about empowering women. She founded social enterprise Krama & Co. that is dedicated to supporting education for girls and providing opportunities for women who weave beautiful krama (hand woven scarves, masks, and other products) which Rebecca imports and sells. She is also the founder of Giving Seeds of Love, which uses craft as a form of therapy whilst making beautiful paper mache hearts. The hearts are made from waste paper from the tributes left outside Al Noor Mosque and the Botanic Gardens after the events of 15 March 2019, and contain wildflower seeds, chosen for their diversity, beauty and resilience. They can be planted in pots or in a garden. Rebecca says when we all work together on initiatives like Seeds of Love in times of trauma or uncertainty, we are able to create a vibrant living reminder of the unity that has been fostered.

                    Zahra Hussaini has a heart of gold and loves to serve her community. She is of Afghan ethnicity, was born in Iran, and came to New Zealand in 2004 as a refugee. After Jo reached out to Zahra about her idea to run an event for women, Zahra brought together four of her other friends over lunch, which was the genesis of Uniting Canterbury Women. Along with being super kind, Zahra is also super busy. She is completing her Science degree as a lab technician, is one of the very hospitable partners in Saffron Restaurant and Café (a must visit!), works as an advocate for the Afghan community and as an interpreter, and has previously run for both Christchurch City Council and Parliament (on the Labour Party list). She also manages to find time to run the Uniting Canterbury Women Instagram page. Zahra loves coffee, meeting new people and socialising. She believes in actions - not only words, something she lives by every day.

                    One-of-a-kind, Amber Johnson has the biggest heart and has been an active volunteer in the Christchurch community for well over a decade. She helped to create a Children’s Group for children affected by their loved ones’ addictions and in 2017, created free community education evenings called CED (Community Education Discussion) Nights, which focused on a range of important topics. Amber worked collaboratively with Christchurch Resettlement Services to create and initiate a wonderful community craft group project, which she still runs, called Craft Without Borders. The aim of the project is to connect former refugees with the wider community, and open channels for people to come together to work on a project, teach, learn and get involved in their community through creativity. Last but not least, Amber has been a volunteer for the Street Wise Feed the East Programme and continues to volunteer at a dog shelter. On top of her incredible volunteer efforts, Amber manages to fit in a full time IT support role at Ara Polytechnic. She enjoys getting into the outdoors with her Latvian husband, and beloved dog, Luna, and is also in the process of becoming a qualified yoga instructor.

                    In addition to her full-time role as a lecturer at Lincoln University, Dr Hafsa Ahmed seeks to make a meaningful impact in the world through service. Guided by her values of faith and freedom, she is often involved in initiatives that serve her purpose. She believes her approach to life is best captured through this quote: “The value of our lives is not determined by what we do for ourselves. The value of our lives is determined by what we do for others.” (Simon Sinek). Therefore, together with her husband Razi, Hafsa founded the Lady Khadija Charitable Trust, which believes in the principles of ‘empowering communities through compassion.’ The Trust has initiated a wide range of exciting projects to achieve social cohesion in the community which includes the Boxes of Love project, podcast OpenTable, the annual interfaith discussion forum Together in Humanity and more recently Immigrant Journeys. Hafsa also serves as the current Chair of the Canterbury Interfaith Society and a Board member at Ako Ōtautahi Learning City Christchurch. Her latest initiative is a series titled ‘Unquiet Women’ supported by Asia Medic Centre, which features stories about Asian women in Aotearoa, New Zealand as she hopes these stories will bring Asia closer to New Zealand by enabling us to see through the eyes of others and nurturing connections.

In 2010, Naeema married her husband, Jawad Arefi, they have been blessed with two lovely boys, named Bahram and Ali. Naeema’s children are the joy of her life, and Bahram is currently learning three languages – English, Farsi and Arabic. Before leaving New Zealand for Sydney with her family, Naeema was an active member of her community. She was also studying an Arabic translation course to form a deeper connection with the Qur’an and to implement the greatness of it into her daily life.

                  Easter recipe – Lemon Biscuits

                  <p>
                    With Easter weekend upon us, we asked Ninotchka (Nin) McKay, a post graduate student from St Martins, to share why Easter is her favourite Christian holiday. Nin has also kindly provided a recipe for Lemon Biscuits, which she loves to make and decorate in an Easter theme, with her two children Isla (13) and Asher (5) who are pictured, having fun with lots of creative designs. “We all enjoy a good Easter egg hunt, and plenty of chocolate, but Easter is also a bittersweet time. It can be hard to translate the message behind this week for children without terrifying them. However I think it can be comforting for kids to pray to a Jesus who understands what it’s like to be misunderstood, teased or jeered on the playground, and it helps to set some context for all the ‘unfair’ stuff happening in the world right now.” 
                    Nin says the key message of Easter, that God’s overwhelming, undeniable love for his people is so big that he would sacrifice his son, then resurrect him with the promise of eternal life to all who follow him, is a powerful message that can help when the world feels broken. “I guess that’s why Easter features chickens and eggs – the idea of new life and a new start. Self-reflection and asking for forgiveness when you get it wrong is another hopeful and accessible message for anyone young or old.”

                    <b>Lemon Biscuits</b> 
                    This biscuit is a great Easter recipe to make with children, and is perfect for everything from school lunches to elegant high tea. 
                    - 100g Butter (room temperature) 
                    - ½ teaspoon salt 
                    - Zest of a small lemon 
                    - 1 cup sugar 
                    - 1 egg 
                    - 2 tablespoons milk 
                    - 2 cups of flour 
                    - 1 teaspoon baking powder 
                    - ½ teaspoon baking soda 

                    Preheat oven to 180oC (not fan forced). 
                    Line two cookie sheets with non-stick baking paper. 
                    Cream first four ingredients until pale and fluffy. (A stand mixer is great if you have it) 
                    Whisk together milk and egg.  Sift dry ingredients. 
                    Add milk/egg mixture in three batches, along with a teaspoon of the sifted dry ingredients each time (this is so the mixture doesn’t split).  Mix well after each addition. 
                    Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix until a soft dough forms.  Be aware that mixing too much at this stage will give you a ‘tough’ biscuit.  I prefer to do this stage by hand.  Dump out the dough onto a floured surface – it doesn’t matter if you have some dried ingredients not quite mixed at the bottom of the bowl. Form it together into a flat-ish ball.  Using clingfilm or baking paper, wrap the dough and chill it in the fridge for about 10-15 mins. 
                    When your dough is chilled, roll it out to around 1cm thick and cut out biscuit shapes.  If you don’t have a cutter, you could roll it into a sausage shape and cut slices to form your biscuits. 
                    Bake for 8-10mins until lightly golden and cool completely before adding your decorations. 
                    We used a ‘writing icing’ pack with several small coloured pre-mixed icings from the supermarket, hundreds and thousands and mini marshmallows to create their easter themed biscuits.  These are lovely just plain in lunchboxes or they are a brilliant ‘dunker’ with a hot drink.

                  Clothed in Love
                </div>

                <div class="story-item-intro">
                  Louisa Stewart and Kim Steetskamp have delivered over 1000 packs of free, good quality children's clothing to families in need.

                  <p>
                    A random post on Facebook around 18 month ago, sparked an idea which has resulted in good friends Louisa Stewart and Kim Steetskamp setting up Clothed in Love, which has already provided packs of free, good quality preloved or new clothing to hundreds of children in need in Ōtautahi Christchurch, says Louisa. “We saw a post about a pre-school looking for jackets and shoes for kids who needed them. My husband said, surely there is something we can do?”  
                    Louisa knew her friend Kim had a soon to be empty space on her large property, and approached her with an idea to create a clothing bank, to streamline the process between parents who had children’s clothing they would like to pass on, and families who needed them. “Kim said she and her husband Scott could give me a 20 foot container to use, but she wasn’t sure she would have the time to help. Famous last words!” 
                    The women started collecting pre-loved clothing for children aged 0–16 years from donors across the city, and set up a Facebook page where families/whanau in need, or organisations, could apply for a clothing pack for their child or children. Most packs include everything from underwear, socks, pyjamas, and swimming togs, to tops, pants, shorts, skirts, dresses, and even jackets and gumboots. “Our packs are a gift of love, and are never a handout,” says Louisa. 
                    Last year Clothed in Love put together 710 packs for children in the Christchurch, Selwyn and North Canterbury areas. With the current economic pressures, demand is already outstripping that in 2022, says Louisa. “At the end of February, I sent a bulk email out to all the Decile 1–8 schools in Christchurch, and within three days we had requests for clothing packs for 250 children. In March and April to date we have already delivered an incredible 362 packs, which is over half of what we sent out in the whole of last year.” 
                    Over the last 18 months, Clothed in Love has grown from two women with a great idea and an impressive work ethic, to a registered charitable organisation, with a Board, a team of 80 active volunteers, and an extra 40 foot container to run their operation. “Our wonderful volunteers are split into teams – those who open their homes as drop off points for donations; our sorting and packing teams who operate from our Yaldhurst base at different times over a month; our courier team who donate their time and petrol to pick up donations and deliver packs; and our washing team, who gift their time and washing machines to ensure the donations are good to go. Some incredible businesses have also come on board to help us, and we have built key relationships with support organisations and schools across Christchurch who do great mahi with families and children.”   
                    Clothed in Love also accepts monetary donations, which are put towards things like new underwear, socks, and other items in short supply, as well as running costs. Their new website goes live soon. 
                    The organisation’s generosity has many benefits. As well as helping to relieve financial and emotional pressure for families/whanau, Clothed in Love helps to reduce the carbon footprint by repurposing clothing which may have otherwise been destined for landfill. 
                    Between them, Louisa and Kim have six children, so understand the pressures of caring for a growing family. Louisa says they have been friends for a few years and their different personalities are a strength. “Kim is our day-to-day person, she loves to be out in the container with our folding and sorting teams. My role is more around strategies and systems, and ensuring our teams are running smoothly.” 
                    Louisa and Kim and their families have strong faith, with the name Clothed in Love, inspired by a proverb in the Bible – “Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us together in perfect harmony.” (Colossians 3:14).  
                    “We know we are reaching out to a community which will differ in belief, faith, family makeup, life choices, and backgrounds, however we are sure we all share one thing in common – the importance of loving others. Clothed in Love is focused on loving those who are perhaps the most vulnerable, our children. However in loving them, we are also loving their families, their friends and their communities.”

                  As part of her healing journey, following the tragic loss of her son, Sayyad, Noraini Milne is promoting unity, growth and well-being in her community.

                  <p>
                    Yellow was Sayyad Ahmad Milne’s favourite colour, and, since his tragic passing in the terror attack on 15 March 2019, it has become a symbol to honour him. Many young players wore yellow in memory of Sayyad at a futsal tournament for youth, organised by his mother Noraini, exactly three years on from that terrible day, to pay tribute to the young Shuhada (martyrs) who lost their lives.
                    The colour yellow evokes a sunny, bright, youthful energy which perfectly describes Sayyad, a football mad 14-year-old, who dreamed of becoming a professional footballer. Early in March 2019, he was looking forward to a futsal tournament in Wellington with his Cashmere High School team. Noraini told him on the morning of 15 March, that his tickets to Wellington were booked. Sadly, he never made it. 
                    Noraini was also at Al Noor Mosque during the attack, hiding from the gunman in another room. It is incomprehensible to imagine what she and the other impacted members of the Muslim community have gone through.  
                    Early on, and in honour of the heartbreaking loss of Sayyad, Noraini decided she was going to embark on a healing journey, and to continue to do good works in the world. At the court hearing, before the gunman’s sentencing, she bravely told him, “My survival comes as a great blessing and when I reflect on that day, I have decided I will live my life doing great things for our people, our community.” 
                    Noraini has been true to her word. She has continued to empower young people, and their families, through Active Muslim Explorers, a group founded in 2016 which has regular retreats that provide physical and spiritual activities, with a focus on developing leadership skills. 
                    Her latest initiative is called Sow a LYTTEL Seed, which she has founded with the support of her neighbours Cathy Lum-Webb and Crile Doscher. The group’s purpose is to bring people together from in and around Lyttelton and seed opportunities for healing, growth and well-being. “Sow a LYTTEL Seed was founded to represent our Sayyad’s legacy, consisting of kindness, empathy, love and hope, and what 15 March 2019 means to us. The aroha and support we received from the wider community and especially people in the Lyttelton community, has been overwhelming, and this is a way of giving back. I’m so grateful for the help of Cathy and Crile who have been selfless with their time and are dear friends as well as neighbours.” 
                    With no official events held to mark the third anniversary of the attack, Noraini and Sow a LYTTEL Seed partnered with a number of different organisations to run community-led activities as part of Unity Week, organised by the Sakinah Community Trust, to promote unity, peace, and encourage support for the Muslim community. “As well as honouring the 51 Shuhada, the events were about celebrating diversity and inclusion and showing gratitude for the support we received – so many things.” 
                    The first event called ‘Healing Hearts & Growing Together’ on Monday 14 March, was run in conjunction with Beck Parnham and Giving Seeds of Love. This was a lovely opportunity for women to come together, make seeded hearts infused with wildflowers with the help of Beck, reflect on everyone’s journey over the last three years, and talk about what the future could be.  
                    On Tuesday 15 March, Sow a LYTTEL Seed partnered with Mainland Football, Canterbury Cricket, Ferrymead Bays Football Club and Lyttelton Primary School, to run a 5-aside memorial futsal tournament at the Lyttelton Recreation Centre. Shirts in various colours with names of the young Shuhada were worn by the players representing the young lives lost on the day - Mucaad Ibrahim, 3. Sayyad Milne, 14. Hamza Mustafa, 16. Muhammad Haziq bin Mohd Tarmiz. 17, Talha Naeem, 21 and Tariq Omar, 24, who all had a love of football. “It was a pleasure working with Hussain Hanif, Diversity and Inclusion Manager for Canterbury Cricket and Mainland Football on this initiative, and we look forward to many more collaborations with both of these organisations to promote sports as platform to celebrate diversity and holistically enhance youth well-being,” said Noraini.
                    After recently completing his epic walk for peace and unity from Dunedin to Christchurch, Temel Atacocugu, who was shot nine times in the attack, gave an inspirational speech to the youth after the futsal tournament about the future of peace and unity through the next generation.
                    On Thursday 17 March, Sow a LYTTEL Seed, Giving Seeds of Love, and Active Muslim Explorers organised a very special event at New Brighton Pier, where a stunning artwork, designed by Sudi Dargipour, was created in the sand by Wayne Webb, with the help of Temel Atacocugu. This event was generously supported by Sakinah Community Trust, Ōtautahi Creative Spaces and Purapura Whetu. The inspiration for this project came from a series of workshops by Janneth Gil as part of her Darkness into Light project, which uses art as therapy for women. 
                    Sow a LYTTEL Seed is considering future events, which may include embroidery classes, walking football games, and a volleyball tournament for women. 
                    The group’s logo has deep meaning for Noraini, with the circle representing togetherness and strength, the Arabic calligraphy a reminder of Noraini’s Muslim background, the word Shifaa meaning healing, and the colours green, representing Islam, and of course yellow, Sayyad’s favourite colour. “The name, Sow a LYTTEL Seed was inspired by a quote on a plaque that we installed alongside the 51 trees that were planted at Pony Point Reserve in honour of those lost, which reads ‘When you sow a seed of kindness and empathy it grows into 51 trees of love and hope.”
                    With the seeds of opportunity that Noraini is planting in her local communities and beyond, some very tall, strong trees of love, hope, kindness and empathy, in honour of her beautiful son, and all those lost, are sure to grow. “Helping people to heal is one of the most important aspects of Sow a LYTTEL Seed. There are lots of broken-hearted people, and people in pain, and while it is good to talk about peace and unity, we can’t truly have this unless we are healed. I’m not shy but I sometimes find it hard to put things into words, which is why I am more of an action person. Our Sow a LYTTEL Seed events are a great way to bring our community together, but they also provide a space where people can talk to someone and get things off their chest. We want to contribute to peoples’ healing, well-being and growth. InshaAllah.”

                  A voice from the past – suffragist Kate Sheppard

                <div class="story-item-intro">
                  Renowned suffragist Kate Sheppard's legacy continues to impact women over 120 years after New Zealand women got the vote. Just who was Kate Sheppard?

                  <p>
                    It is easy to be moved when standing in the tasteful dining room at Te Whare Waiutuutu Kate Sheppard House, imagining the spirit of Kate Sheppard, the other suffragists, and leading figures for women’s rights who gathered there to plot, plan and create what proved to be the epicentre of the women’s global suffrage movement.
                    We can also only imagine the joy, pride, and likely some relief, Kate must have felt when she was in her garden on 19 September 1893 and received the telegram advising her that women had finally had won the right to vote in New Zealand. The arduous five-year nationwide campaign she had led, had finally achieved its goal, against fierce opposition.
                    So who was Kate Sheppard?
                    The well-known images of Kate evoke a genteel, beautifully dressed, middle class Victorian woman, which was true of her position in Christchurch society in the late 1800s. However, it was her challenging early years in the United Kingdom which really forged her character and strong sense of social justice.
                    Kate was born in Liverpool in 1847, to Andrew and Jemima Malcolm, who both had Scottish heritage. The family moved around a lot, eventually to London, where when Kate was just four years old, her father disappeared from their lives forever. The family always said he died 10 years later in Dublin, when in fact he had sailed to New York to join the US Army. He died of delirium tremens in New Mexico in 1862, but the family never breathed a word of the secret. 
                    Andrew had left the family one step away from homelessness, so Kate was sent to live with her maternal aunt and uncle, William Barclay, who was a Minister with the independent Free Church. With them, Kate gained a good education and developed a sense of standing up for things that weren’t right.
                    Kate migrated to New Zealand aged 20. Her sister Marie had married drapery merchant, George Beath, who set up Beath’s Department Store in Christchurch. Kate married George’s friend, Walter Sheppard in 1871. George Beath paid for his wife’s family to sail to New Zealand first class. Kate and Walter’s only child, a son Douglas was born in 1880.
                    In 1885, the Women’s Christian Temperance Movement hit New Zealand, when Mary Leavitt arrived from the United States to lecture New Zealand women about prohibition of alcohol. Kate signed up and was soon the National Superintendent of Franchise and Legislation, which included questioning laws around women. This was the beginning of her work as a suffragist.
                    During the important campaign years from 1888 to 1893, Kate was living at the Clyde Road house, busily writing articles and letters, organising and sending out pamphlets, preparing speeches, lobbying members of parliament and directing other suffragists and women’s organisations throughout New Zealand.
                    It was around Kate’s dining table that the third, and ultimately successful, large petition, consisting of 31,872 signatures gathered from women all around New Zealand, was pasted onto a large roll by Kate and other suffragists, and sent to the House of Representatives in Wellington. Their victory was a world-first achievement and led to many other women around the world gaining the right to vote. The New Zealand suffragists also wanted women to be able to get into Parliament so they could start making social reforms for women and children.
                    Kate was known as a very good speaker, who would gently win her arguments through humour and using her intelligence. She was able to rally people and get them on board. She was also a fashionista, whose weakness was beautiful clothes.
                    In 1902, nine years after the vote for women was won, Kate and Walter Sheppard decided to sell their Clyde Road house and return to England. Walter travelled with their son, Douglas, while Kate took an apartment in the centre of Christchurch before leaving in 1903. Kate’s health deteriorated, and on medical advice she returned to Christchurch, amicably parting with Walter, and living with her great friends, William and Jennie Lovell-Smith. Kate had largely retired from public speaking and activism by this time apart from writing and later supporting suffragists in the United Kingdom.
                    Tragedy struck in 1910, when her son Douglas died of pernicious anaemia at the age of just 29, followed by her only grandchild, Margaret at the age of 21 in 1930. 
                    Kate married William Lovell-Smith in 1925, a year after he was widowed. In 1933, a year before Kate passed away, Elizabeth McCombs of Lyttelton, became the first women elected to Parliament. It had been Kate’s hope that women would eventually be represented in Parliament, so it was wonderful she saw it happen in her lifetime and her legacy came full circle.

                    When Suhayla Asghari arrived in New Zealand as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2004, she was an 11-year-old girl who spoke little English, and had already survived life-threatening situations, including capture by the Taliban.
                    It was difficult for Suhayla to adapt to life in New Zealand in the beginning, and she found it difficult to communicate with her classmates. It took two years before she started to feel comfortable here.
                    Since those early days, Suhayla found her wings and thrived, getting her degree and achieving a Master of Social Work from the University of Canterbury. She currently works at Māori health and social services organisation Purapura Whetu as a Wellbeing Practitioner, tirelessly supporting the Muslim community.
                    Co-founder of Uniting Canterbury Women, Dr Hafsa Ahmed has written a wonderful profile of Suhayla for her series ‘Unquiet Women’ about Asian women who have migrated to New Zealand, and which is supported by the Asia Media Centre.

                    When Uniting Canterbury Women was organising our inaugural event in 2019, we thought it might be nice to include a small Linden Leaves product in the gift packs we were planning to give to each woman who came to the event. So we reached out to Brigit Blair, founder of the internationally renowned Christchurch company to see what we could purchase with our very small budget.
                    We were certainly not counting on Brigit’s incredible generosity. The gift packs we gave out that night became the stuff of legend, as they included not one, but four, beautiful full-sized Linden Leaves products.
                    We love having Brigit as such a wonderful supporter of Uniting Canterbury Women and are inspired by her incredible business success story. Did you know that Brigit founded Linden Leaves in her kitchen in 1995, after struggling to find natural and effective skincare for her children, who suffered from severe eczema and allergies? She started hand-making her own beautiful and effective natural products, using oils and the best ingredients.
                    From these humble beginnings, Linden Leaves has grown into a thriving international brand, which has won numerous awards, both in New Zealand, and globally for its luxury, handmade natural skincare, body care and beautiful scented products for the home, which are now available in nine countries.
                    We were delighted to have Brigit as our very first online ‘Dinner Club’ guest in July 2020, when she provided a fascinating insight into her inspiring story. She also shared some important wellbeing tips, and advice for thriving in life and business in the COVID-19 world.

                  The story of the real ‘Nurse Maude’ and her incredible legacy is truly fascinating. She was a genuine trailblazer.

                    Most of us would have seen the Nurse Maude cars zipping around Christchurch, driven by caring district nurses and palliative care nurses doing amazing work in our community.
                    Did you now that the wonderful work of the ‘original’ Nurse Maude – a Christchurch nurse named Sibylla Emily Maude, led to the birth of district nursing in Christchurch and around New Zealand?
                    Born in 1862, the eldest of eight children, Sibylla grew up in a deeply religious Anglican family. The example set by her father, who was at the time of her birth, Provincial Secretary, and two of her aunts who were nurses appears to have inspired in her a desire to help other people.
                    She rose to the role of matron of Christchurch Hospital by 1893 but left that role in 1896 to begin the work for which she was most remembered – caring for the old, infirm and poor in their own homes.
                    Nurse Maude got financial backing to undertake district nursing in the city, and established a headquarters in Durham Street, which served as a dispensary and a place where minor ailments were treated. In 1901, the District Nursing Association was founded to support the work.
                    Dressed in a light-blue uniform and white apron with dark-blue cape and bonnet, Nurse Maude walked many miles every day in all weathers, carrying not only nursing equipment but often the pans for cooking, cleaning and washing which many people lacked. She tried to teach her patients the importance of cleanliness and fresh air, and as a woman of prayer she invariably prayed with them.
                    More nurses joined – and a horse and cart and bicycles were provided to transport them.
                    Nurse Maude opened two sanitoriums for tuberculosis in Christchurch and during the influenza epidemic which started in 1918, was put in charge of the central bureau to coordinate the nursing of influenza victims in the city. In the difficult 1920s she opened a soup kitchen for undernourished children.
                    Nurse Maude never married and died on 12 July 1935. Her funeral was attended by large crowds who came to pay tribute to the most celebrated women in the city at the time.
                    She was greatly respected and loved for her genuine practical sympathy for the poor and her complete integrity. Thanks to the impact of her work, district nursing was developed throughout the country.
