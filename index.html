                  <p>Uniting Canterbury Women was devasted to hear about the plight of the evacuees who fled Afghanistan to New Zealand at the end of August to escape the brutal new Taliban regime. Many men, women and children went through an incredibly traumatic time to get here and arrived with little more than the clothes on their backs. 
                  We were determined to do something to help, so started a Givealittle campaign to raise money to create individual Welcome Packs for the evacuees at the Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre. This was a cause especially close to our hearts, as two of our current crew members, Zahra Hussaini, and Suhayla Asghari are former refugees from Afghanistan. They both spent time at the Centre on their arrival to New Zealand, and never forgot the kindnesses they received.
                  We easily surpassed our goal to raise $11,000 – reaching over $14,000 in the end thanks to great support from Kiwi donors. Our campaign also attracted the support of generous social enterprises and businesses who either donated goods for the packs, or offered wholesale prices or less. Even former Prime Minister, Helen Clark got behind the Givealittle campaign, mentioning it almost daily on her social media platforms, and there was a story on 1News at Midday talking about the initiative. 
                  In early October, with the help of some awesome women, we packaged up around 250 very special Welcome Packs, filled with items that would introduce the evacuees to their new country, and also remind them of home. The packs included fragrant spices, saffron, and tea which was specially blended by Zahra.
                  The women were gifted beautiful silk krama (scarves) handwoven in Cambodia, Linden Leaves products and TradeAid bags, among many other items, while prayer mats, woollen hats and thermos flasks were among the items in the men's packs.
                  We were so excited to hear that the packs arrived in Auckland, and can’t wait for the feedback from the Centre.

              Almost 600 women came to the inaugural Uniting Canterbury Event at the Centennial Chapel at St Andrew’s College in Christchurch on 10 July 2019. It was a beautiful evening of connection, support and aroha for our Muslim sisters, following the tragic terror attack.

            Around the World in Eight Cafes
          </div>
          <p>
            Uniting Canterbury Women hosts coffee and food catch ups for women from all cultures and ethnicities in Christchurch. Each time, the groups meet at a different ethnic café, to connect, share stories, share food, and learn new things about the food and culture from the café owner. Not only is it a great way to connect women, we also learn about different cuisines and cultures, and support small local ethnic businesses. It’s a win win!
          </p>
          <p>
            We are grateful to The Christchurch Foundation, and Fife Foundation, for their support of our Around the World in Eight Cafes initiative.

                Uniting Canterbury Women was founded after the tragic terror attack in Christchurch on 15 March 2019.
              </p>
              <p>
                Co-founder, Jo Bailey reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to talk about how to continue on the beautiful love and support for the Muslim community being shown by people in Canterbury and New Zealand, and Uniting Canterbury Women was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zahra introduced Jo to four of her friends, Rebecca Parnham, Dr Hafsa Ahmed, Amber Johnson, and Naeema Masud. The six women bonded over coffee and cake, and together, organised the inaugural Uniting Canterbury Women event, which was attended by nearly 600 women.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Jo Bailey and Rebecca Parnham continue to lead Uniting Canterbury Women and organise a range of events to connect wāhine across all cultures. They are supported by the rest of the UCW team, and new crew member, Suhayla Asghari, when they are available to assist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uniting Canterbury Women has a popular Facebook page with over 1250 followers. Zahra Hussaini runs the group's thriving Instagram page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many incredible connections and friendships have been made and continue to be made across the Uniting Canterbury Women community.

                  Jo Bailey is a writer, editor, author, publisher, and social change activist, who believes in kindness, celebrating our diversity, and equality for all. Uniting Canterbury Women was created after Jo had the idea to run an event for women, to carry on the feelings of connection and compassion for our Muslim community after the tragic events of 15 March 2019. She reached out to her only Muslim friend at the time, Zahra Hussaini, to chat about the idea, and thanks to Zahra’s amazing connections, UCW was born. Jo continues to co-lead UCW alongside Rebecca Parnham. She is a passionate storyteller, journalist and freelance writer and editor, and is the author of four books. Jo is also an accomplished public speaker, and teaches people how to write their own or family stories during her Writing Life Stories Your Way workshops. She is also the proud mum or two gorgeous grown-ups.

                  Rebecca Parnham has energy to burn and comes up with lots of amazing ideas, that UCW often bring to life. As well as being a mum to two gorgeous girls, Rebecca is passionate about empowering women. She founded social enterprise Krama & Co. that is dedicated to supporting education for girls and providing opportunities for women who weave beautiful krama (hand woven scarves, masks, and other products) which Rebecca imports and sells. She is also the founder of Giving Seeds of Love, which uses craft as a form of therapy whilst making beautiful paper mache hearts. The hearts are made from waste paper from the tributes left outside Al Noor Mosque and the Botanic Gardens after the events of 15 March 2019, and contain wildflower seeds, chosen for their diversity, beauty and resilience. They can be planted in pots or in a garden. Rebecca says when we all work together on initiatives like Seeds of Love in times of trauma or uncertainty, we are able to create a vibrant living reminder of the unity that has been fostered.

                  Zahra Hussaini has a heart of gold and loves to serve her community. She is of Afghan ethnicity, was born in Iran, and came to New Zealand in 2004 as a refugee. After Jo reached out to Zahra about her idea to run an event for women, Zahra brought together four of her other friends over lunch, which was the genesis of Uniting Canterbury Women. Along with being super kind, Zahra is also super busy. She is completing her Science degree as a lab technician, is one of the very hospitable partners in Saffron Restaurant and Café (a must visit!), works as an advocate for the Afghan community and as an interpreter, and has previously run for both Christchurch City Council and Parliament (on the Labour Party list). She also manages to find time to run the Uniting Canterbury Women Instagram page. Zahra loves coffee, meeting new people and socialising. She believes in actions - not only words, something she lives by every day.

                  In addition to her full-time role as a lecturer at Lincoln University, Dr Hafsa Ahmed seeks to make a meaningful impact in the world through service. Guided by her values of faith and freedom, she is often involved in initiatives that serve her purpose. She believes her approach to life is best captured through this quote: “The value of our lives is not determined by what we do for ourselves. The value of our lives is determined by what we do for others.” (Simon Sinek). Therefore, together with her husband Razi, Hafsa founded the Lady Khadija Charitable Trust, which believes in the principles of ‘empowering communities through compassion.’ The Trust has initiated a wide range of exciting projects to achieve social cohesion in the community which includes the Boxes of Love project, podcast OpenTable, the annual interfaith discussion forum Together in Humanity and more recently Immigrant Journeys. Hafsa also serves as the current Chair of the Canterbury Interfaith Society and a Board member at Ako Ōtautahi Learning City Christchurch. Her latest initiative is a series titled ‘Unquiet Women’ supported by Asia Medic Centre, which features stories about Asian women in Aotearoa, New Zealand as she hopes these stories will bring Asia closer to New Zealand by enabling us to see through the eyes of others and nurturing connections.

                    When Suhayla Asghari arrived in New Zealand as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2004, she was an 11-year-old girl who spoke little English, and had already survived life-threatening situations, including capture by the Taliban.
                    It was difficult for Suhayla to adapt to life in New Zealand in the beginning, and she found it difficult to communicate with her classmates. It took two years before she started to feel comfortable here.
                    Since those early days, Suhayla found her wings and thrived, getting her degree and achieving a Master of Social Work from the University of Canterbury. She currently works at Māori health and social services organisation Purapura Whetu as a Wellbeing Practitioner, tirelessly supporting the Muslim community.
                    Co-founder of Uniting Canterbury Women, Dr Hafsa Ahmed has written a wonderful profile of Suhayla for her series ‘Unquiet Women’ about Asian women who have migrated to New Zealand, and which is supported by the Asia Media Centre.

                    When Uniting Canterbury Women was organising our inaugural event in 2019, we thought it might be nice to include a small Linden Leaves product in the gift packs we were planning to give to each woman who came to the event. So we reached out to Brigit Blair, founder of the internationally renowned Christchurch company to see what we could purchase with our very small budget.
                    We were certainly not counting on Brigit’s incredible generosity. The gift packs we gave out that night became the stuff of legend, as they included not one, but four, beautiful full-sized Linden Leaves products.
                    We love having Brigit as such a wonderful supporter of Uniting Canterbury Women and are inspired by her incredible business success story. Did you know that Brigit founded Linden Leaves in her kitchen in 1995, after struggling to find natural and effective skincare for her children, who suffered from severe eczema and allergies? She started hand-making her own beautiful and effective natural products, using oils and the best ingredients.
                    From these humble beginnings, Linden Leaves has grown into a thriving international brand, which has won numerous awards, both in New Zealand, and globally for its luxury, handmade natural skincare, body care and beautiful scented products for the home, which are now available in nine countries.
                    We were delighted to have Brigit as our very first online ‘Dinner Club’ guest in July 2020, when she provided a fascinating insight into her inspiring story. She also shared some important wellbeing tips, and advice for thriving in life and business in the COVID-19 world.

                    Most of us would have seen the Nurse Maude cars zipping around Christchurch, driven by caring district nurses and palliative care nurses doing amazing work in our community.
                    Did you now that the wonderful work of the ‘original’ Nurse Maude – a Christchurch nurse named Sibylla Emily Maude, led to the birth of district nursing in Christchurch and around New Zealand?
                    Born in 1862, the eldest of eight children, Sibylla grew up in a deeply religious Anglican family. The example set by her father, who was at the time of her birth, Provincial Secretary, and two of her aunts who were nurses appears to have inspired in her a desire to help other people.
                    She rose to the role of matron of Christchurch Hospital by 1893 but left that role in 1896 to begin the work for which she was most remembered – caring for the old, infirm and poor in their own homes.
                    Nurse Maude got financial backing to undertake district nursing in the city, and established a headquarters in Durham Street, which served as a dispensary and a place where minor ailments were treated. In 1901, the District Nursing Association was founded to support the work.
                    Dressed in a light-blue uniform and white apron with dark-blue cape and bonnet, Nurse Maude walked many miles every day in all weathers, carrying not only nursing equipment but often the pans for cooking, cleaning and washing which many people lacked. She tried to teach her patients the importance of cleanliness and fresh air, and as a woman of prayer she invariably prayed with them.
                    More nurses joined – and a horse and cart and bicycles were provided to transport them.
                    Nurse Maude opened two sanitoriums for tuberculosis in Christchurch and during the influenza epidemic which started in 1918, was put in charge of the central bureau to coordinate the nursing of influenza victims in the city. In the difficult 1920s she opened a soup kitchen for undernourished children.
                    Nurse Maude never married and died on 12 July 1935. Her funeral was attended by large crowds who came to pay tribute to the most celebrated women in the city at the time.
                    She was greatly respected and loved for her genuine practical sympathy for the poor and her complete integrity. Thanks to the impact of her work, district nursing was developed throughout the country.

                    Since those early days, Suhayla found her wings and thrived, getting her degree and achieving a Master of Social Work from the University of Canterbury. She currently works at Māori health and social services organisation Purapura Whetu as a Wellbeing Practitioner, tirelessly supporting the Muslim community.
                    Co-founder of Uniting Canterbury Women, Dr Hafsa Ahmed has written a wonderful profile of Suhayla for her series ‘Unquiet Women’ about Asian women who have migrated to New Zealand, and which is supported by the Asia Media Centre.

                    When Uniting Canterbury Women was organising our inaugural event in 2019, we thought it might be nice to include a small Linden Leaves product in the gift packs we were planning to give to each woman who came to the event. So we reached out to Brigit Blair, founder of the internationally renowned Christchurch company to see what we could purchase with our very small budget.
                    We were certainly not counting on Brigit’s incredible generosity. The gift packs we gave out that night became the stuff of legend, as they included not one, but four, beautiful full-sized Linden Leaves products.
                    We love having Brigit as such a wonderful supporter of Uniting Canterbury Women and are inspired by her incredible business success story. Did you know that Brigit founded Linden Leaves in her kitchen in 1995, after struggling to find natural and effective skincare for her children, who suffered from severe eczema and allergies? She started hand-making her own beautiful and effective natural products, using oils and the best ingredients.
                    From these humble beginnings, Linden Leaves has grown into a thriving international brand, which has won numerous awards, both in New Zealand, and globally for its luxury, handmade natural skincare, body care and beautiful scented products for the home, which are now available in nine countries.
                    We were delighted to have Brigit as our very first online ‘Dinner Club’ guest in July 2020, when she provided a fascinating insight into her inspiring story. She also shared some important wellbeing tips, and advice for thriving in life and business in the COVID-19 world.

                    Most of us would have seen the Nurse Maude cars zipping around Christchurch, driven by caring district nurses and palliative care nurses doing amazing work in our community.
                    Did you now that the wonderful work of the ‘original’ Nurse Maude – a Christchurch nurse named Sibylla Emily Maude, led to the birth of district nursing in Christchurch and around New Zealand?
                    Born in 1862, the eldest of eight children, Sibylla grew up in a deeply religious Anglican family. The example set by her father, who was at the time of her birth, Provincial Secretary, and two of her aunts who were nurses appears to have inspired in her a desire to help other people.
                    She rose to the role of matron of Christchurch Hospital by 1893 but left that role in 1896 to begin the work for which she was most remembered – caring for the old, infirm and poor in their own homes.
                    Nurse Maude got financial backing to undertake district nursing in the city, and established a headquarters in Durham Street, which served as a dispensary and a place where minor ailments were treated. In 1901, the District Nursing Association was founded to support the work.
                    Dressed in a light-blue uniform and white apron with dark-blue cape and bonnet, Nurse Maude walked many miles every day in all weathers, carrying not only nursing equipment but often the pans for cooking, cleaning and washing which many people lacked. She tried to teach her patients the importance of cleanliness and fresh air, and as a woman of prayer she invariably prayed with them.
                    More nurses joined – and a horse and cart and bicycles were provided to transport them.
                    Nurse Maude opened two sanitoriums for tuberculosis in Christchurch and during the influenza epidemic which started in 1918, was put in charge of the central bureau to coordinate the nursing of influenza victims in the city. In the difficult 1920s she opened a soup kitchen for undernourished children.
                    Nurse Maude never married and died on 12 July 1935. Her funeral was attended by large crowds who came to pay tribute to the most celebrated women in the city at the time.
                    She was greatly respected and loved for her genuine practical sympathy for the poor and her complete integrity. Thanks to the impact of her work, district nursing was developed throughout the country.
